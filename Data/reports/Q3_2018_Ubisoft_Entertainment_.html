<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Presentation
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT, CO-FOUNDER, CHAIRMAN, CEO &amp; PRESIDENT, UBISOFT
ENTERTAINMENT SA: Good afternoon, and good morning, everybody. Thank you for
joining our conference call.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  In the third quarter, we nicely outperformed our expectations,
thanks to 2 key drivers that are essential to our long-term development and
success: First, we continued to make great progress with live operations.
Rainbow Six Siege was huge again, Ghost Recon Wildlands had a very solid
performance and The Division was loaded for its fantastic comeback. Finally,
Assassin's Creed Origins is on track to almost double players'
playtime versus prior Assassin's Creed titles. This is an amazing
achievement.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  The second driver, the increasingly recurring nature of our
business, is also having an impressive impact on our new releases. With more
time to polish our games, we have been able to release 3 high-quality titles
since August with Assassin's Creed Origins, South Park and Mario +
Rabbids. This achievement further reflects the profound transformation we
have been delivering over the past years. We have recognized the need to
transform the DNA of our portfolio to engage players over a longer period of
time. As such, we have invested heavily in new brands and evolved our
franchises with a stronger focus on multiplayer and RPG mechanics. And today,
the majority of our franchises engage players over the long term.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  We have also focused our energy and resources on a smaller number
of releases to maximize their potential. Finally, we have fully embraced the
significant increasing resources required to develop ever bigger games. In
the past 10 years, we have hired over 9,000 talented people, and we were the
first to set up the Multi-studios organization with a major focus on
collaboration as well as on skills and technology sharing.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  We believe our strong execution is indicative of the benefits of
both, the transformation and our long-term approach. I now hand over the call
to Alain.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ALAIN MARTINEZ, CFO, UBISOFT ENTERTAINMENT SA: Thank you, Yves,
and hello, everybody. Our Q3 sales ended up higher than initially
anticipated. Sales reached EUR 725 million, up 37% year-on-year, outpacing
both our initial target of EUR 630 million and the recently revised target of
EUR 700 million. We achieved this strong performance despite a EUR 22 million
negative impact from exchange rates.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Our growth was principally driven by our new releases.
Assassin's Creed Origins confirmed the early impressive trends we
highlighted in November. Players are thrilled with the splendor of Ancient
Egypt, the huge scope of Origins world and its new gameplay. The game
outperformed versus our expectation and was the third best-selling title in
the EMEA in calendar 2017. This confirms the successful comeback of
Assassin's Creed franchise, and it is very promising.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  We have also been very pleased by Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle,
which was the #1 third-party game on the Switch in 2017. The success of its
recent release in Japan confirmed this strength. With the Switch's
strong momentum, Mario + Rabbids should benefit from long-lasting sales.
Ubisoft emerged as the clear third-party leader on Switch, and we will
continue to build on our great 10-year-plus relationship with Nintendo.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Our performance this quarter was also spurred by the long-term
support of our games and of our communities. Here are some details: the
implementation of RPG mechanics in Assassin's Creed Origins combined
with a very ambitious first-launch plan had a very positive impact on
players' engagement; year 1 playtime is expected to almost double in
comparison to the franchise average excluding Black Flag, which already
featured RPG elements; on live operations, our success with great conversion
rates. For example, 42% of players used the photo mode and shared already
over 42 million photos with our community. 64% of players have also engaged
in the Avenge quest. The March quarter has already seen the release of The
Hidden Ones DLC. We will launch another great update with The Curse of the
Pharaohs DLC, and we will offer players the discovery tool, a combat-free
mode that we liked as a virtual museum of ancient Egypt.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  The momentum behind our Tom Clancy titles continues to be
extremely strong, with close to 60 million unique players for the combined
Tom Clancy brands. This represents an acquisition of close to 60 million new
players to the franchise since our update last May. This was obviously driven
by the performance of The Division, Ghost Recon Wildlands and Rainbow Six
Siege that I will now detail.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  The 1.8 update of The Division has been extremely well received.
The game is in its greatest state ever, and players enjoyed the wide and
varied set of available endgame activities. As a result, engagement following
the update has more than doubled in December. The division achieved its best
acquisition level since March 2016. The production team at Massive
Entertainment will continue to support the game going forward.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  With Ghost Recon Wildlands, the introduction of the free PVP mode,
Ghost War, combined with a free DLC starring the legendary Predator,
contributed to solid engagement levels. The Development team's
commitment to monthly updates to the PVP mode was very well received by the
community. Wildlands ranked as the seventh best-selling game in EMEA and 10th
in NCSA in calendar 2017, adding another strong franchise to Ubisoft's
roster of multiplayer brands.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  The quarter also saw another amazing performance from Rainbow Six
Siege. MAU reached new records in December with the release of Operation
White Noise. The game is continually ranked in the top 5 most played titles
on Steam, and it ended up in the top 10 most watched games on YouTube in
2017. The team will release Outbreak on March 6, a limited time co-op event
that will run for 4 weeks.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  The game's eSport momentum continues to gain steam. The
number of viewers for the season 3 final in SA[pounds sterling]o Paulo was 2x
bigger than the prior season final. Rainbow Six Siege Pro League has recently
welcomed Evil Geniuses, Team Liquid, FaZe Clan and Counter Logic Gaming, some
of the biggest and best-known eSport organizations.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Finally, we recently unveiled a new format for upcoming years. Our
competitive scene will have a longer season, with the addition of the second
major event in August and an additional circuit of minor events that will
bring the total events to 2 majors, 2 Pro League finals and 4 minors in
addition to national leagues in 17 countries.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  One year after the launch of For Honor, more than 7.5 million
players have joined the battlefield, with over 1 million unique players
playing every month. The game also ranked fifth most-viewed new game on
Twitch in 2017. More than 5,000 elements of new contents and 30 games updates
have been enriched the game so far. We will continue supporting the game
throughout 2017.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  On February 15, For Honor's fifth season, Age of Wolves, will
bring major updates to the game, including the deployment on February 19 of
the highly anticipated dedicated service on PC and soon after on consoles.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  The Ubisoft Club continues to be a differentiator to Ubisoft and
to bolster player engagement across games and platforms. And since its
release 2 years ago, 475 million club challenges have been assigned in
Rainbow Six Siege. Community challenge have also been integrated in
Assassin's Creed Origins, and we continue to play an important role in
future titles.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  We are making good progress on the mobile side with Q3 revenue up
76% year-on-year, driven by Ketchapp, Growtopia and by new the new release of
South Park: Phone Destroyer and Might &amp; Magic: Era of Chaos. Phone
Destroyer had the best performance ever achieved by a game released by our
internal studio. Era of Chaos, developed by Playcrab and published by
Tencent, just crossed the EUR 100 million gross revenue in China. Finally,
Ketchapp saw its revenue grow more than 100% year-on-year. Its recent
launches, Finger Driver and Knife Hit, both ranked most downloaded games on
iOS in the U.S. Moreover in January, Ubisoft announced a new partnership with
Tencent to bring a selection of Ketchapp games to its newly launched mobile
web scene mini-game application. Weixin, the WeChat mirror application for
Mainland China users, is the most popular mobile application in the country
with around 980 million MAUs. This represents a fantastic opportunity for
Ketchapp to broaden its audience in China.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  As you can see, our live services continue to drive strong
engagement and digital performance. In only 9 months, we have already reached
the same level of unique players, session days and playtime that we did in
the full fiscal year '17.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Over the 9 months, group MAUs, excluding mobile, were up 34%
year-on-year and mobile DAU were up 170%. As a consequence, 9-month digital
revenue reached EUR 670 million, up 75% year-on-year and player recurring
investment was up 87% to EUR 319 million. Digital and PRI represented,
respectively, 56% and 27% of total revenue, a steady progression versus last
year of 47% and 21%.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Digital distribution for AAA titles represented 55% of total
distributed units versus 48% last year.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Over the first 9 months, back-catalog momentum continues to be
very strong with revenue of EUR 609 million, up 32%. It amounted to 51% of
total revenues, confirming the recurring profile of the business. During the
third quarter, back-catalog grew 13%. Last year comparison's base was
particularly strong with the release of Assassin's Creed [Age of
Trilogy] as well as Survival, the second paid expansion of The Division.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  From a geographical standpoint, Asia revenues were up almost 87%
year-on-year, excluding Japan, and the region continued to represent a
meaningful growth opportunity.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Let's now turn toward the full fiscal year '18. We
confirm today our targets with revenue of approximately EUR 1,640,000,000,
and non-IFRS operating income of approximately EUR 270 million. In light of
our strong Digital momentum, we are now expecting Digital at around 55% of
total revenue versus above 50%. Player recurring investment should end up
around 25% of total revenue versus above 21% previously. And back-catalog is
now expected at around 45% versus above 40% previously.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Our assumption remain the same with stock-based compensation of
around EUR 40 million, net financial charges of around EUR 30 million and
with the number of diluted shares at roughly 122 million shares.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Regarding the average tax rate, we are still evaluating the impact
of the recent U.S. tax changes. For the time being, we are maintaining our
assumption of around 25%.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Regarding exchange rates. Our full year assumptions are based on
the euro at USD 1.17 and at CAD 1.49. We expect Q4 sales of approximately EUR
449 million versus EUR 649 million last year. This drop has can be explained
by having 2 releases, For Honor and Ghost Recon Wildlands in last year Q4
versus 1 this year and by the fact that Far Cry will be released right at the
end of March. With preorder pacing ahead of any previous Far Cry game at this
period before launch, Far Cry 5 is gearing up to be both the most successful
entry in the franchise and the biggest multi-platform launch for the first 8
months of the calendar year. Players are being drawn in by the engaging cult
theme and setting in Montana, U.S.A. The recently announced Far Cry season
pass was also well received by players who are excited about the setting of
the DLC, which includes traveling back in time to Vietnam, facing hordes of
zombies and by leading Earth to battle Martians arachnids.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Finally, we are also confirming our fiscal year '19 targets,
namely sales of around EUR 2.1 billion, non-IFRS operating income of around
EUR 440 million and free cash flow of around EUR 300 million. As announced in
December 7, we are updating the assumption behind our top line target. To
reflect the increased recurrence and profitability of our business as well as
the reshuffling of our lineup, we are now expecting to sell around 23 million
units of our 4 AAA titles versus 20 million units previously. At the same
time, Digital expectation have been raised to represent around 60% of total
revenue versus above 55% previously. PRI continues to be expected above 25%.
Back-catalog is expected to grow strongly and to represent over 45% of total
revenue. Our assumptions are based on a euro at USD 1.25 and at CAD 1.52.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  I now hand over the call back to Yves.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: Thank you, Alain. Now to conclude, we have again
demonstrated strong execution across the board, with great performance from
our new releases and back-catalog games as well as with very solid progress
on live operation, Ubisoft has never been better positioned to deliver its
3-year plan. We are committed to create great long-term value, and there is a
lot more to come well beyond 2019. So we are now ready to take your
questions.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Questions and Answers
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) We'll take our first
question today from Tim O'Shea from Jefferies.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  TIMOTHY LARKIN O'SHEA, EQUITY ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: So player recurring investment surged 87% this quarter. My
question is how much of this growth is coming from AC? Your big open world
games like Assassin's Creed typically haven't generated the same
kind of PRI compared to other -- your multiplayer titles like the Tom Clancy
shooters. So I'm just curious how AC is monetizing post launch. Alain,
obviously, spoke about the RPG elements driving engagement. I'm
wondering how this engagement is translating into PRI.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: Thank you for your question. Yes, the PRI on
Assassin's Creed is a lot better than what we had on the other formats
-- on the previous releases, sorry. What we can say, though, is that overall,
it is important, but it is not the most important PRI generator.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ALAIN MARTINEZ: And by the way, on the quarter, the PRI improved
by 96%. The 87% is over 9 months. So as you can see, during the quarter, we
had terrific growth of PRI.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: And what we can see is when the time played is
increasing, there's always a good growth of the PRI.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  OPERATOR: We'll take our next question from Nicolas Langlet
from Exane.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  NICOLAS LANGLET, RESEARCH ANALYST, EXANE BNP PARIBAS, RESEARCH
DIVISION: I've got 3 questions, please. The first one on Assassin's
Creed, any chance you can share with us the number of units sold in Q3? And
what's your base estimate for the full year? Second question on
Assassin's Creed, again, Origins. Can you tell us what was the
attachment rate of the recent season pass? And how this compared to previous
AC Syndicate? And last question on Rainbow Six, can you tell us a bit more
regarding the evolution of the number of members, average daily user and
[extra progression], et cetera?
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: So on Assassin's Creed number of units, what
we can say is that the trend was to double Assassin's Creed Syndicate,
and the game continues to do extremely well. So we can't give specific
numbers, but it's really on track to on its lifetime do around 2x what
the previous one did.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ALAIN MARTINEZ: In terms of the season pass, we don't have
any particular data to provide right now, the attach rate versus last one, I
would say.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: What we can say is that it's a lot better
than what we had before.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ALAIN MARTINEZ: And regarding Rainbow Six, what we said is that in
December, we really had a record amount of players week after week. So we are
very happy about how Rainbow Six is behaving. And we feel that if we are
right, the game is set to continue to grow in the coming months and years.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  NICOLAS LANGLET: Okay, okay. If we look for example at the close
to 60 million members for the Tom Clancy franchise, how much of that was
related to Rainbow Six?
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ALAIN MARTINEZ: We are talking here of unique players. That means
that somebody could play on Rainbow Six and also on Ghost Recon -- so both
The Division -- on both The Division. So those are unique players. And of
course, I think the last time we spoke about Rainbow Six, we mentioned that
we had over 25 million players that have come to play on that game that are
registered on the Rainbow Six. And the community is still growing. The team
will -- by the way, update the data in the coming weeks for each of the games
to give more indication to the gaming community.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Chris Merwin from Goldman
Sachs.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  CHRISTOPHER DAVID MERWIN, RESEARCH ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP
INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: I just had a couple. So I see you had a really
strong 3Q for PRI, which by its nature is a more recurring source of revenue.
Just curious why the 4Q guide came down a little bit on sales. Is that -- and
that's just from your December update. Is that conservatism against your
FX headwinds or any other factors affecting the new guidance for the 4Q? And
then secondly, also on the topic of PRI, I imagined that's also very
positive for the margins of the business and you also maintained your full
year outlook on operating income as well. So do you expect that you're
getting higher incremental margins for PRI? Or are you investing those back
in the business anywhere? Any place that you could call out for us?
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: Yes, just to -- for Q4, what you have to consider,
as Alain mentioned earlier, is that last year, we had 2 releases, 2 big
releases. This year, we have 1 with Far Cry 5 and it's happening the
27th of March. So it has quite an impact on the quarter. Maybe Alain, you
have more comments?
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ALAIN MARTINEZ: Yes. What I can say is that when you -- we
announced EUR 700 million, we always try to be a bit more conservative so I
would say that, again, we believe that the EUR 469 million we gave as a
reference for fiscal -- for quarter 4 is prudent also. So we don't feel
that there is any particular downside. On the contrary, we feel that all our
back-catalog is doing well. The releases that we launched in the first 9
months are performing well. They will be stronger than last year. It is just
that we have less new launches and that there is an impact on that. Besides
-- regarding the profitability, I would say that if you look at what was the
scenario at the beginning of the year and what it is today, you can say that
we will achieve EUR 1,640,000,000 and EUR 270 million of EBIT on 2.5 games
versus 4 games at the beginning of the year, with also the fact that the U.S.
dollar -- or the euro didn't really go in the way we would have loved.
So if you consider all that, I would say that we actually pretty much
outperformed in profitability. And you will see that taking place in terms of
gross margin because as we grow our Digital revenue, we will have better
gross margin. We expect also to make some good efficiency results on the
sales -- the SG&amp;A. However, on the R&amp;D, as we said, the games are
more ambitious. We have higher live operation. So we expect our R&amp;D to be
a bit higher than last year. So that gives you a little bit of flavor of what
it is going to happen. And for next year, it will be, I think, a bit similar.
Most of the improvement of our profitability will come from gross margin and
sales and marketing efficiency. So those are the really big elements. But as
you said, we are probably reinvesting in R&amp;D to make sure that we deliver
the right quality and the right services.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: To cope with the competition.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ALAIN MARTINEZ: Yes.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  OPERATOR: Next question comes from Robert Berg from Berenberg.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ROBERT BERG, ANALYST, BERENBERG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. Two
questions from me. The first is actually around free cash flow. Maybe one for
Alain. Going back a couple of years and you had that pretty significant
working capital outflow when you went from 1 smaller Q4 release, I believe,
in South Park to 2 larger ones in the following year. Now you're going
back from 2 large ones to 1, and that 1 being on the 27th of March. Should we
expect a pretty significant working capital inflow this year? Or is there a
reason why that would not be the case? And the second question is around your
eSports and the kind of impressive viewerships that you're seeing now
for a couple of your games. We can see from the revenues engagement some of
the indirect benefits that you're seeing with regards to monetization.
But are you thinking -- or could you detail any steps you are taking, if any,
of directly monetizing eSports, whether now or in the next few years, whether
through tournaments, games, sponsorship, et cetera?
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: So I will probably answer on eSport and Alain will
come back on cash flow. So on eSport, really, what we said last time and we
continue to do that is really create the sport lead time with very, very
strong teams all around the world. And with time, we will see more and more
monetization. Yesterday, it's indirect monetization as we have more and
more players joining the game because of the competition they watch. What is
very impressive is the growth of viewership of our competition. And I'm
going in MontrA[c]al next week to see the final that will happen next Sunday.
So what we see is this is taking more and more space on social media and we
think that if we continue to perform like that, we will be able to make
Rainbow Six one of the biggest eSport games in the industry. So very quickly
after that, there will be lots of revenue coming from that as well. But the
priority is really to make sure people have fun, that they can play from
anywhere with the best teams around. And if we manage to do that, we will
really create a sport that will be acclaimed and watched everywhere.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ALAIN MARTINEZ: So coming to cash flow, what I can say is at this
stage, we expect cash flow for fiscal year '18 to be higher than fiscal
year '17. You know we had EUR 86 million free cash flow last year. I
would think that we are going to exceed EUR 100 million. That said -- and it
would be even more because we are making the decision this year to not
discount some of the our receivables, whether it's the tax credit in
Canada or some of our accounts receivable from customers. So that represents
probably close to 60 million. So as you can see, that would be more than the
doubling of our free cash flow versus last year. And as you mentioned, one of
the reasons is that we will have a lower working capital even though we do
not discount all our receivables as we did last year. On the other side,
because we postponed some of the games or at the end of the year onto next
year, the gap between R&amp;D capitalized will be still high. As we mentioned
several times, we expect that gap to be closing down quite significantly next
year while we will have 4 major games. And because of that reason, a greater
share of our EBIT next year will turn -- will materialize in free cash flow.
I hope this is clear.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  OPERATOR: We'll take our next question from Mike Hickey from
The Benchmark Company.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  MICHAEL JOSEPH HICKEY, RESEARCH ANALYST, THE BENCHMARK COMPANY,
LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Two questions. One, I think you just introduced loot
boxes into Rainbow Six Siege and Wildland, as Yves talked to the success
there, the monetization versus the feedback you may have gotten from the
community. And also curious about, I guess, maybe in Europe versus the last
year, it seems like there's potentially more pressure from the
regulatory front in terms of potential framework around [loot boxes and
introduction to the games]. And I have a follow-up.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ALAIN MARTINEZ: Okay. On loot box, what we can say is that
it's -- we define it as a question of quality and choice, as simple as
that. And it's really related to every player recurring investment,
whether it's loot box or something else. Clearly, we need to deliver for
whatever we offer the right quality for people to be interested. And at the
same time, they need to feel that they are really free to not buy it. And
their choice is really a fact. We do believe that the way we've done it,
whether it's in Rainbow Six or actually also in Assassin's Creed,
where we offer much more to monetize and we get much greater monetization has
been actually well perceived. You're right, there has been some
discussion in a few countries about how that should be treated. Clearly, the
discussion that we are having today seems to go -- when people I explain how
it works, the discussions are much more, I would say, much calmer than they
initially appeared. So we feel that we're going in the right direction,
and we don't feel that there is a major issue, a regulatory issue that
we should be facing.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: Our priority is (inaudible) -- and it's
possible to our players.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  MICHAEL JOSEPH HICKEY: Okay. The last question from me. I guess
just as it relates to Nintendo, I think you sort of have a unique
relationship now, obviously, success with Mario + Rabbids. I just hope you
could talk more about the success, overall, of that collaboration with
Nintendo. And any sort of strategic opportunities that you see for yourself
and Nintendo in the future, maybe thinking about Nintendo IP and
possibilities on mobile.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: So yes, this relationship continues to grow, and
we are very happy with what we were able to achieve with Mario + Rabbids. And
we must not also forget the fact that Just Dance is also a big seller on the
Switch and that it will continue to follow the growth of that machine. And
yes, in the future we are going to do more things. We just can't go over
that right now.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Doug Creutz with Cowen and
Company.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  DOUGLAS LIPPL CREUTZ, MD AND SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, COWEN AND
COMPANY, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. The Division has had kind of a long and
bumpy road, but it does seem to have gotten to a place where the player bases
are happy. To the extent that you're working on, let's just say a
game versus one of The Division now, I know you guys haven't announced
Division 2. But how able are you to incorporate the things you learned from
line services in a game into the ongoing development you may have on new
games?
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: It's a good question. In fact, the game is
always a recipe to try new things and the -- not a recipe, sorry, a place to
try new things. And we are experimenting lots of new game plays and lots of
new elements in The Division 1. And that's helping us to prepare for
what could come in the future in the brand. So yes, having lots of players
playing and giving feedback to the teams regularly is something that helps
tremendously to come with better content.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ALAIN MARTINEZ: I think we have 2 objectives: making our community
happy, and I think we achieved that; and the second is, as you rightly said,
it was to try everything we could to polish the game to make it the best
experience possible. I think now we have a much clearer idea of what should
be done for the future. So that was very positive.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) We'll take a question from
Charles Scotti from Kepler.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  CHARLES-LOUIS SCOTTI, RESEARCH ANALYST, KEPLER CHEUVREUX, RESEARCH
DIVISION: Three questions if I may. You also had a nice improvement of player
recurring investment in Q3 and over the 9 months. Can you give us a little
bit color on the development of concentration of this player recurring
investment as, I guess, that Rainbow Six Siege accounts for most of that?
Second question on Assassin's Creed, now that you have made a quite
successful comeback from Assassin's Creed, do you intend to launch
Assassin's Creed again on a yearly basis? And my third question is a
more general one. After this strong hiring phase, do you think you are able
to release more AAA titles, let's say, 5 or 6 AAA titles a year, which
will be a way also for you to gain market share on top of more player
engagement?
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: Thank you for your question. So yes, the PRI is
distributed around many games. You can consider Rainbow Six, Assassin's
Creed, Ghost Recon, The Division, For Honor, The Crew, Steep, so all of those
games are generating good PRI, thanks to the fact that they are played a lot.
So we are very happy with the dedication of players and the teams to make
sure we can bring a great experience on all those games. So we see a good
trend there with more fun and more revenue. So under the Assassin's
Creed subject, we are concentrating at the moment on ACO, for which we are
going to launch a few of the DLCs. So you will be amazed by what we will come
on ACO. So that's the only thing we can say now.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ALAIN MARTINEZ: And on the number of games, clearly, we are not
going to go to 6 or plus games for the future. Really, we try to go with ever
bigger games, more successful. And actually what we were trying to convey as
a message is that the fact that our back-catalog, that our live services are
delivering so much benefit to the company, it is relieving us from the
must-have release that we had in the past. So really, today, as you have
seen, we have been able to deliver a much better performance with only 2.5
games. So next year, there will be 4 games. We believe that it is a pretty
good number.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: And the goal is really to increase the number per
game and increasing the quality so that if we -- they can stay longer on the
market and they can be more and more appreciated by players.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  OPERATOR: It appears there are no further questions. At this time,
I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Guillemot for any additional or
closing remarks.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: Well, thank you very much for listening today, and
have a great day or a great evening. Thank you. Bye-bye.
