<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Presentation
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  OPERATOR: Good day, and welcome to the Ubisoft FY '18
Earnings and Sales Conference Call. At this time, I would like to turn the
conference over to Guillemot, President and CEO. Please go ahead.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT, CO-FOUNDER, CHAIRMAN, CEO &amp; PRESIDENT, UBISOFT
ENTERTAINMENT SA: Good afternoon, and good morning, everybody. Thank you for
joining our conference call.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  So our industry is thriving. We are reaching more people on more
platforms through even greater variety of business model. It is striking to
see that in the past 6 months, there have been record performances from many
games in parallel to the surge of battle royale titles. On our side,
following the strong comeback of Assassin's Creed, we delivered a record
launch for Far Cry 5. We also achieved new engagement records for our live
operations in the March quarter. This clearly shows that in a dynamic and
competitive landscape, our industry offers significant opportunities. More
people play, they spend more time playing, and they enjoy more and more our
highly polished games experiences.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Ubisoft is therefore in a great position to continue creating
significant shareholder value during the coming years. As such, we remain
focused on delivering strong execution across the board and on leveraging our
long-term strategy. This strategy is based on IP ownership, on investing in
our team skills and on a dependable production organization capable to
deliver both high-quality games and strong customer services. We are building
an even more adaptable company and leveraging our track record in engaging
with our communities and in integrating them as true stakeholders. This trend
will be key asset in capturing all the opportunities offered by the upcoming
evolution of our industry.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  The short and medium term is exciting, both in terms of potential
top line growth and profitability progression. Opportunities are plentiful
from our catch-up momentum on digital to the massive potential of the mobile
and PC markets, notably in China and to our strides in eSports.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Over the longer term, thanks to the arrival of new forms of gaming
driven notably by streaming, we have the opportunity to significantly expand
our addressable market. It will notably be driven by our investment in the
Ubisoft Club, our online platform, strong of 88 million unique active players
on console and PC. We are also pursuing our investment in artificial
intelligence and machine learning to tailor the gaming experience to each
gamer's profile and to offer them stronger and deeper experiences.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  With such meaningful short- and longer-term opportunities, it is
clear we are just starting to reap the benefits of the digital transformation
we have been successfully conducting. I want to thank our teams for the
amazing work they deliver every day.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  I'll now hand over the call to Alain.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ALAIN MARTINEZ, CFO, UBISOFT ENTERTAINMENT SA: Thank you, Yves,
and hello, everybody. We achieved record revenues in fiscal year '18
with sales of EUR 1,732,000,000, EUR 92 million higher than our revised
target. This represents a growth of 19% despite a negative exchange rate
impact of EUR 55 million versus last year. In Q4, we continued to execute
strongly across the board. Far Cry had a record launch, making it the second
best launch for a Ubisoft game ever and the best-selling game in the
franchise, doubling the week 1 sales of Far Cry 4. Digital distribution has
been very strong, and the games' great content offering resulted in a
stronger than expected season past performance that will benefit fiscal year
'19. These trends should continue well into fiscal year '19, with
strong reorders and with a great post-launch plan built notably around the
release of 3 initial DLCs.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Assassin's Creed Origin is still going on strong and has
achieved record revenue for an Assassin's Creed game in the fourth
fiscal quarter. The extended run has been bolstered by regular content
update, coupled with stronger player engagement, and the game ended the year
with remarkable digital performance. The recent DLC release, The Curse of The
Pharaohs, has been unanimously reprised. It reflects our focus on delivering
not only great games but also very high-quality post-launch contents and
services.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  On the back-catalog side, we have continued to engage with our
communities and to onboard them in our live operation. Here are some notable
events.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Rainbow Six Siege reached new engagement records during the
quarter with a new seasons release, the Six Invitational 2018. The biggest
eSports event on the Rainbow Six scene was a success with a 300% increase in
viewership versus last year. The next major event will be the Six Major in
Paris this August. Rainbow Six Siege is well above 30 million registered
players, and the team continues to execute superbly on its clear vision. They
are listening to and deeply engaging with the Rainbow Six community to build
and grow the game for the next 10 years.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  We continue to be astonished by the great work done by the Ghost
Recon Wildlands team. They are delivering fantastic content on a regular
basis, and the game's registered players has surpassed 10 million
players. Wildlands saw very solid engagement over the past months following
the release of a Splinter Cell mission, which was very well received. With
its second year of appealing post-launch content recently announced, the team
demonstrates its agility to build a true platform that engage players over
the long run.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  For Honor's team successfully implemented the new dedicated
server architecture with greatly improved matchmaking and stability. The new
services, combined with recent adjustment to game balancing and the
introduction of new training modes, resulted in a significant improved
in-community sentiment. For Honor will see plenty of new content including
new heroes and events in fiscal year '19. We can't wait to tell you
more at E3.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  With a dedicated community of more than 20 million registered
players, the future is promising for The Division franchise. Following the
success of The Division substantial update, 1.8 Resistance, we unveiled 2 new
global events plus an Xbox One X enhanced 4K Ultra HD optimization. In March,
we announced that The Division 2 is in development by the team that created
the original game. The team is passionate about integrating all the learnings
they have accumulated over the past 2 years. The Division 2 will hit shelves
in fiscal year '19. We are excited to show you more at E3.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  At the group level, we reached new record MAUs and peak concurrent
users during the quarter despite fewer releases than last year. Full year
MAUs were up 22% year-on-year, and mobile DAUs were up 130%. Engagement from
Asian players, notably from China, has grown strongly. And new play PC, our
platform for online services and distribution, has reached new MAU and PCU
records. Finally, new French relationship activated through the Ubisoft Club,
a measure of the platform network effect, were up 40%. All these resulted in
a strong digital performance representing a record 58% of total revenue
versus 50% last year.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Player recurring investment was the strongest driver of our
performance, up 59% over the year and represented a record 28% of total
revenue, up 7 points. As part of player recurring investment, mobile,
profitable for the first time, saw strong growth of 66% and represented 5% of
total group's revenue, highlighting the massive catch-up opportunity for
Ubisoft. Spurred by digital strength, back-catalog reached a new record of
48% of total revenues, up 3 points. This confirms once more the increasingly
recurring nature of our business, which provides us with much stronger
visibility than in the past. This increased visibility has played a
fundamental role as it allowed us to allocate more time to polish our new
releases to reach the high level of quality that player expect, which in
turns increase those games overall potential. This is exactly what happened
with Assassin's Creed Origins and Far Cry this year. This is also
supporting our confidence in the quality and impact of our upcoming releases
starting with The Crew 2 next month.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  On the earnings side, our strong top line performance translated
into record non-IFRS operating income of EUR 300 million versus our target of
EUR 270 million. Worth mentioning, we outperformed our target despite an
exchange rate headwind of EUR 32 million as we had started the year with a
U.S. dollar assumption at $1.09. Cash flow from operations ended up at EUR
215 million, with significant improvement versus last year.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Let me go in more detail. The non-IFRS operating income stood at
EUR 300 million versus EUR 238 million last year, up 26%. This EUR 62 million
improvement reflects gross margin increasing by EUR 246 million, thanks both
to high sales and to a 1.5% margin improvement, setting a new margin record
of 82.9%. It is worth noting that the lower gross margin on switch sales
partially reduced the positive impact of the 8-point increase in digital
sales. On the other side, R&amp;D expenses grew by EUR 139 million. I'll
detail this increase later on. Variable marketing expense grew EUR 14
million, and we are down 1.5 points versus last year. This reflects the
efficiency gain spurred by the digital transformation as well as the strength
of our back-catalog. Finally, structure cost increased by EUR 30 million, EUR
7 million of which were related to one-off costs linked to the Vivendi exit.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Moving to Page 19 of our presentation, which details our R&amp;D
expenses and investment. The EUR 139 million increase of our total R&amp;D
reflects the EUR 55 million increase of depreciation on a stronger lineup as
well as additional depreciation charge booked on to be released titles ahead
of a very competitive year. EUR 82 million increase in the noncapitalized
expense as we continue expanding our successful lives operation. Greater team
bonuses linked to games' increase profitability are also impacting this
line. The EUR 110 million increase of our cash R&amp;D comes mostly from the
noncapitalized expense, which now represent 25% of our total investment, up 8
point versus last year. On the other side, capitalized R&amp;D grew 5%. This
confirms that greater part -- a greater part of our R&amp;D investment are
now related to current operation, delivering regular revenue and
profitability. Consequently, the gap between R&amp;D expenses and investment
stood at EUR 59 million, down EUR 30 million from prior year.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Moving to Slide 20. The IFRS, non-IFRS reconciliation shows 3
types of adjustment: the traditional stock-based compensation charge standing
at EUR 40 million as expected; a noncurrent charge of EUR 38 million related
to brand and goodwill depreciation; and finally, a financial charge of EUR 8
million related to the implicit convertible bond option cost. As expected,
our overall average tax rate closed at 25%.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Finally, Slide 21. Free cash flow stood at EUR 111 million versus
EUR 86 million in fiscal year '17. This reflects a EUR 105 million
increase of our cash flow from operation, of which EUR 62 million came from
our EBIT improvement and EUR 30 million from the narrowing of our R&amp;D
P&amp;L versus cash gap that I mentioned earlier. This was partially
compensated by EUR 84 million negative swing in our working capital, EUR 63
million linked to our decision not to factor any receivable this financial
year, giving the strong line of credits already available. Net acquisitions
of EUR 179 million included a EUR 100 million deposit on the EUR 200 million
swap agreement relating to the Vivendi exit. This deposit was booked as a
capital asset acquisition and should revert to liquidity by September 2018.
In addition, we spent EUR 79 million on M&amp;A transaction, down EUR 28
million versus fiscal year and purchased a total of EUR 412 million of shares
including EUR 300 million from the prepaid forward agreement linked to the
Vivendi exit. As a result of those different flows, we ended the year with a
EUR 548 million net debt.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Let's see on Page 22 how we plan to reduce it over fiscal
year '19. First, our free cash flow target adds up EUR 300 million for
the full year. Second, we expect to receive over EUR 100 million in the first
half of the year from our latest employee shareholder plan. For information,
most of the newly share created will be compensated by the cancellation of
the 1.4% shares we had bought in the first half of fiscal year '18.
Finally, as mentioned earlier, the EUR 100 million outflow on the EUR 200
million swap agreement should move from deposit, i.e. debt, to short-term
liquidity asset -- liquid assets. Altogether, those factors should bring down
our net debt by EUR 500 million by year-end. This, plus the fact that we
disposed of EUR 1,250,000,000 of long-term fully committed funding, of which
the EUR 400 million convertible loan well in the money, gives us all the
financial means we need. We will be able to continually exploring external
growth opportunity as we have done in the past as well as financing the EUR
200 million remaining swap shares.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Let's now move to fiscal year '19. As announced on May
9, we will start to apply IFRS 15 new accounting norm at the time of the
first quarter fiscal year '19 communication. For more details, please
refer to the appendices of our earning release.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Today, we are introducing an IFRS 15 sales target, and we are
renaming our prior revenue target based on prior accounting standards as net
bookings.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Fiscal year '19 IFRS 15 sales are expected around EUR 2
billion. Net booking, again corresponding to our prior sales definition, is
now expected at around EUR 2,050,000,000 versus EUR 2.1 billion previously.
The non-IFRS operating income based on net bookings and free cash flow
targets are confirmed at, respectively, approximately EUR 440 million and EUR
300 million.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  As we have done in the past, we are updating our top line
assumption to reflect the faster-than-anticipated digital transformation. We
now expecting digital at approximately 65% of net booking versus around 60%
previously, with player recurring investment now at approximately 30% versus
25% -- over 25% previously. Back-catalog is expected at approximately 50% of
net booking versus above 45% previously.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  As with prior updates, we are taking advantage of the benefits
brought by digital, both in terms of additional revenues and profitability to
reduce risk. As a consequence, we have decided to invest more time in the
development of Skull &amp; Bones, which is now expected for fiscal year
'20. The number of units expected on the 3 AAA new releases is now
around 19 million unit versus 23 million for 4 AAA games previously. This
reflects both Skull &amp; Bones moving out of the year as well as a lower
exposure to other new releases. As such, the 18% year-on-year top line growth
will be mostly driven by back-catalog and player recurring investment.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  First, on the back-catalog side, fiscal year '18 strong top
line growth of 19% will be a notable support. We expect continued strong
performance from Assassin's Creed Origin, significant reorders for Far
Cry 5, mobile growth driven by acquisition, plus, of course, the continued
momentum of our live titles. Second, on the player recurring investment side,
our post launch content offering will see a step-up versus fiscal year
'18 with stronger releases and services. We will provide more
information on those offerings throughout the year. This reflects our
continuously increasing investment in live operation. Now more than ever,
Ubisoft is committed to support its game and its communities for the long run
with great services and content.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  On the new release side, in a very competitive year, we are
looking to launch very strong titles that will benefit from extended
development tide that should support the overall performance. The release
slate will be made of The Division 2, The Crew 2 and one unannounced
franchise title that we can't wait to unveil at E3. These 3 games are
the result of a huge amount of work and passion for our teams over many
years.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  The expected 4-point increase in operating margin will come from
another step-up in gross margin as well as a decrease of R&amp;D and SG&amp;A
costs as a percentage of net bookings.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Regarding the items below the non-IFRS operating income line, we
expect stock-based compensation of around EUR 40 million, net financial
charges of around EUR 9 million, tax rate of 23% and number of diluted shares
of around 118 million shares, reflecting the impact of the prepaid buyback of
4.5 million shares owned previously by Vivendi.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Regarding the exchange rate, our assumptions are based on the euro
at USD 1.22 and at CAD 1.53.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Looking at Q1, based on these positive trends as well as on the
upcoming release of The Crew 2, we expect IFRS 15 sales of approximately EUR
350 million and net booking at approximately EUR 350 million, up 73%
year-on-year.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  The Crew 2 -- The Crew franchise has gathered 14 million players
worldwide to date. The team has focused on making The Crew 2 a more
accessible experience, with more freedom and pure fun. In addition to cars
and bikes, players will be able to race on boats and planes. The Crew 2
offers experience for all types of racers from those who want to drive and
explore America to competitive racers, car enthusiasts and more. We will
support the game for the long run and apply the great learnings we have
accumulated with our live titles to enhance its post-launch operation. Of The
Crew 2 will be released on June 29.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  I now hand over the call to Yves.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: Thank you, Alain.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  To conclude, Ubisoft continues to benefit from its focus on highly
innovative teams, IP ownership, strong execution and a unique production and
creative organization. We are building an adaptable company, deeply engaged
with its community. Operating in a thriving industry with an expanding
addressable market and strong of many growth drivers, Ubisoft is ideally
positioned to continue to grow its top line and profitability over the years
to come.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  So we are now ready to take all your questions.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Questions and Answers
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) We'll go first to Nicolas
Langlet of Exane BNP.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  NICOLAS LANGLET, RESEARCH ANALYST, EXANE BNP PARIBAS, RESEARCH
DIVISION: I've got 3 question, please. The first one on China and the
partnership with Tencent. Can you tell us a bit more regarding the structure
of the partnership? And what are the key initiatives you plan to launch in
the coming months or quarters? And also, if you can give us a view in terms
of sales and profit opportunity you see in the country in the medium term,
that would be great. Second question on the PRI. Can you tell us what is the
share of the in-game transaction in the total PRI and if it was the main
growth driver of that segment in full year '17, '18? And lastly, on
R&amp;D. So you still have the difference between R&amp;D, P&amp;L and cash
of EUR 60 million. How do you see this difference evolving in next year and
the year after?
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: Thank you for your questions. So on the Tencent
deal, what we can say is that this deal is on PC on one side, where we have a
few products that will be published by Tencent. We expect a big growth
happening from the launch of those games that some of them will be actually
relaunched like Rainbow Six. The -- what we can say is that on the other
side, the mobile agreement is an agreement that is going to help us to grow
tremendously our presence in China because the agreement gives us the
opportunity to create a few games together that will be launched in China and
in the rest of the world.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ALAIN MARTINEZ: What we can add is that the role of Tencent will
be to get our games approved locally to market them, to, of course, help us
in order to make the game as adapted to the Chinese market and then to
operate those games locally, which we cannot do today. So those are what on
-- particularly on the AAA game, what will be the role of Tencent. And there
will be revenue share as it is usual, but we don't give detail about
that.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: And what's really good is that we will be
able to embrace China with mobile and PC.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ALAIN MARTINEZ: Regarding the player recurring investment, we
don't really give details of where it goes. What you can expect is that
when you have a new game like, for instance, Assassin's Creed being
released at the beginning of the launch, a large amount of the revenue come
from the DLC. But as the game goes, more and more revenue come from items
being purchased during the game. So that's the way it evolves. So
therefore, the player recurring investment as an average evolve according to
the -- our new games in this life cycle. And regarding the R&amp;D delta, we
expect to grow it from next year, from fiscal year '18 on the basis that
we have decided to postpone Skull &amp; Bones. And for fiscal year '20,
we haven't given an indication of what we expect so we are not going to
communicate on the gap.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  NICOLAS LANGLET: Okay. And just to come back on the comment on
China. So you said you plan to launch Rainbow Six -- a new version of Rainbow
Six in the country. Is it in this fiscal year or the next fiscal year?
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: So it's not a new Rainbow Six. It is the
actual Rainbow Six that will be reaped by Tencent, and we have plans to come
as early as it's possible.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  OPERATOR: We'll take our next question from Tim O'Shea
of Jefferies.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  TIMOTHY LARKIN O'SHEA, EQUITY ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: There's a big debate right now about whether these
battle royale games are expanding the market or whether they're
cannibalizing it, and I was just curious what's your view on the matter,
Yves. I think you noted the record performance of many games in the
portfolio. So is there a way to quantify the impact from battle royale on
your games? What are you seeing, if anything, especially for games like
Rainbow Six Siege that are generating high volumes of PRI?
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: So thank you for the question. In fact, what we
see is that it has an impact like it happens when all the games are launched,
like even when Call of Duty is coming. It has an impact on all the games we
have, but it doesn't stop us to have record revenues and record number
of players playing. So it's like another game, I would say. We see that
all the games we are doing continue to perform very well. And the growth and
the increase, even in all the games we have as game as a service, is
continuing with a good speed.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ALAIN MARTINEZ: As we mentioned, Tim, we had a record number of
players on the Rainbow Six last quarter and excellent revenue levels. So we
see, but it looks very good up to now.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: And what we can say is that it's really good
to have new innovations like that because it's showing that we can have
even more players playing shooter games on the market. So all those new
people that are coming to the industry are really playing more and more the
types of games that we create. So we think it's going to actually boost
the industry.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  OPERATOR: We'll go next to Robert Berg of Berenberg.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ROBERT BERG, ANALYST, BERENBERG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Three
questions from me. The first, obviously, you mentioned in the presentation
and in the guidance that this is a competitive year. It feels like this is
something you've been saying for the past few years that you've
been outperforming expectations. We'd love to hear what is more
competitive about this year compared to your existing expectations at the
half year stage. Is it Fortnite or other games? Also a quick calculation,
tell me if I'm right, you've reduced expectations by about EUR 2
million across 3 games, which doesn't sound too drastic. I just want to
get a sense on how important that comment was. Second question on -- I just
to get an insight into your thinking on the timing of releases versus their
quality. Obviously, it's great to have a better game, but it feels like
you're delaying numerous games now. And how do you think about the
quality versus the timing of the release, whether that's Christmas or
summer? Or is positioning the release slate calendar versus peers? Would be
interested to hear your thoughts there. And third question is on Rainbow Six.
eSports, obviously, a great quarter, a huge peak during the invitational,
showing there's a huge number of people willing to watch the game. And
then you get the big drop back down better than you had thought of it, the
tournament. But I'm just wondering if there's anything you are
trying to do to keep that level of average viewers up between the big
tournaments.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: Okay. Thank you for your questions. So first, what
we see on timing is that the industry changed a little bit because we saw in
the last few years that launching a game, either fourth quarter for us, which
is between January and March; or even second quarter, which is from the 1st
of April through the end of June, is a good timing to launch product. We saw
also that end of August is also good timing. So what we see more and more is
now we can launch games almost whenever we are ready and whenever we want
just because there's a good appetite for our new products on the market,
just thanks to the fact that there are less big games coming to the industry.
So that gives us the possibility to choose when to launch because it's
really the quality that will make the difference in the industry.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ALAIN MARTINEZ: And what I will add is if you remember in fiscal
year -- in February 2016 when we presented our 3-year plan, we presented 5
games for 40 million unit to be sold to arrive at EUR 440 million of EBIT on
EUR 2.2 billion of sales. And interestingly enough, this year we will achieve
the same amount of EBIT with only 3 games. And considering that in the
process, we probably will have had a very negative headwind on the dollar. So
if you add up all of that, it shows up the industry has evolved, and why
it's us but it's also other players have decided to really take a
lot more care through each of their releases and don't hesitate to
postpone when they think that there is a real value for it.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: And there's also one point, which is working
very well, is to continue to put attention to all the games we launched. And
in creating regular content for the players that bought our games, it's
really helping those games to continue to sell. And we have, thanks to that,
also lots of revenue from the players that play for 6 months, 1 year or 2
years for some of those games. So it's helping the back-catalog, and
it's generating good revenue for the company. Now to come back to your
question about competitive -- competition for this year. It's true that
we often say that there's a lot of competition. This year, we see even
more competition than before. But what we feel is that in making sure we come
at the right time, we will be able to take a good part of the potential of
the market because we feel that in launching good games at the right time
will help us to generate bigger revenue for those games.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ALAIN MARTINEZ: Rainbow Six and eSport, maybe you want to...
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: Yes. Rainbow Six continues to grow very fast
because there are more and more players playing it and spending more time on
it. And thanks to that, the eSports growth continues to happen. And we will
have, in Paris, in August, another competition that will be massive. So we
feel that we will continue to grow the eSports trend. We feel that with time,
we can reach -- we can be in the top played games on eSports.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ROBERT BERG: Okay. Great. And just on the couple of million units
of the 3 games, is that a fair assumption for the cut to this year...
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ALAIN MARTINEZ: We spoke about 4 million down including Skull
&amp; Bones, so it depends where you put Skull &amp; Bones. But as we said,
there is some impact on the other games. That's all we can say.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  OPERATOR: We'll go next to Chris Merwin of Goldman Sachs.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  CHRISTOPHER DAVID MERWIN, RESEARCH ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP
INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Okay. As it relates to PRI, it looks like you had
another very strong quarter. The growth rate did slow down a little bit
year-on-year. I imagine part of that is due to some tougher comps. Was there
anything else from a timing perspective that may have impacted PRI in the
quarter? I also noticed that you raised the guidance for PRI to be 30% of
revenue in '19, up from 25% earlier, which I think implies an increase
of about $90 million. So just curious, does that include an incremental
contribution from the games you plan to release in '19? Or is most of
that increase in the guidance from the current portfolio of titles? And then
just one other quick question. You mentioned that you pushed Skull &amp;
Bones obviously into fiscal '20. And apologies if I missed this, but
just wondering if you wouldn't mind updating us on how many AAA titles
we should now expect in '20 and how should we think about units for
'20 relative to '19.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ALAIN MARTINEZ: Okay. Regarding the player recurring investment in
Q4, there is one simple effect, as you know, we launched Far Cry 5. And Far
Cry 5, as we said, had an excellent success in terms of DLC and season past
purchase. But of course, as we didn't deliver that content, we defer
that revenue. So we do have -- we had less player recurring investment
because of Far Cry late launch, which will in turn benefit fiscal year
'19. So it's one of the impact that is mechanically brought to
fiscal year '19. And as you've said, on top of just having that
mechanical effect, we will continue to maintain our games longer and to
create new events and new content. And therefore, we believe that we can grow
that part. And regarding fiscal year '20, we haven't given any
detail of the games, number of games that we will do. That's not
something that we expect to do. Okay. Sorry, maybe -- we didn't get --
your question was, how many games on average can we expect on a yearly basis?
We do expect 3 to 4 years. Of course, we have not given the detail. But on
average, it could be 3 to 4 games.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: AAA games. AAA.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  OPERATOR: We'll go next to Evan Wingren of KeyBanc Capital
Markets.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  EVAN TODD WINGREN, RESEARCH ANALYST, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS INC.,
RESEARCH DIVISION: As you think about The Division 2, how are you preparing
for the follow-on content relative to perhaps the first launch of The
Division?
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: Yes. It's a good question. We were surprised
a little bit by how fast people consume content on the first one. So
we've been working with the teams to really bring a lot of content at
launch and to be ready to continue to supply content a lot during the years
that will follow the launch. So we are working out to make sure we have lots
of content of a label so that people can stay in the game for the long run.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ALAIN MARTINEZ: Yes. Very clearly, the -- what we call the end
game part was something that The Division 1 could have improved, and we
believe that we got it now and that we feel comfortable. Though as we
mentioned, the 1.8 evolution has been very, very well received, so we think
that we have the right tools to deliver a much better game.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: And we are leveraging on all -- we are leveraging
all the experience we accumulate on #1 to make sure we deliver a fantastic
#2.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  EVAN TODD WINGREN: Okay. And then just one question, follow-up on
the guidance for the year. Are you expecting meaningful marketing expenses
for Skull &amp; Bones to hit in the fiscal year '19 even though you
pushed the game release into fiscal year '20?
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: No, very small.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  OPERATOR: We'll go next to Doug Creutz of Cowen.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  DOUGLAS LIPPL CREUTZ, MD AND SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, COWEN AND
COMPANY, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I wonder if you'll talk a little bit
about where you see your opportunities on mobile. Obviously, your success has
largely been driven by games that are away from your core IP. How are you
thinking about what you can do with some of your bigger franchise like
Assassin's Creed or Tom Clancy on mobile? And where do you think the
opportunities are?
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: Thank you. What we see is that the machines are
becoming more and more powerful, especially the mobile machines. So we feel
that with time, coming from this increase of machine power and streaming, we
will be able to really make our games, AAA games, work on mobile machines. So
we are now working with our team so that they can prepare the future games.
Having in mind the fact that they can be on PC, on mobile -- on PC, on
console, but also on mobile via either streaming or directly ported on the
mobile machines.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  OPERATOR: We'll go next to Mike Hickey of The Benchmark
Company.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  MICHAEL JOSEPH HICKEY, RESEARCH ANALYST, THE BENCHMARK COMPANY,
LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: So I guess, my first question is just thinking about
your sort of additional sheer construct on sort of IPs that's already
established. Do you think about what you've done in terms of driving a
live service and PR monies after the launch of the game itself. And now we
have the opportunity -- it looks like as an industry to grow with the battle
royale mode, which it looks like some of your peers will find out shortly
here are going to introduce it to some of their IP, traditional shooter IP.
So I'm just wondering how impactful you think adding a BR -- a battle
royale mode to sort of your traditional PR model off-shooter IP would be in
driving total digital monies or total PRI growth.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: Yes, we see that it's working very well for
the competition. So we, with our teams, are really looking at innovation
coming from competitors, and we are working to make sure we take advantage of
it. And though we can't say more, but we are working hard to make sure
our players can have the benefit of that type of experiences.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  MICHAEL JOSEPH HICKEY: Okay. Good. Any sort of technical hurdles
or issues that would sort of prevent you from being a fast follow in this new
genre?
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: We have engines that are adaptable, and we are
making sure they can deliver the technical needs of those types of gameplay.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ALAIN MARTINEZ: And while we...
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: We can't tell you exactly when it's
coming and which will come, but we like when people come with new innovation
like this because they show also new opportunities for the industry and for
our -- for the experiences and world that we create.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ALAIN MARTINEZ: Yes. And Mike, it's very important that we
take all those innovation, and they are very inspiring. But it's also
important that we create our own innovation. And beyond the battle royale,
our teams are working on many project too, which is also very important. I
believe it's also key not to just do copycat of a mode of a particular
thing, but to create your own innovation on your side, which is really what
makes the difference in most case.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  MICHAEL JOSEPH HICKEY: Yes, yes, yes, no, I agree, guys. I guess,
the last question. It looks like Fortnite, at least, the impact has been
somewhat insulated because the demographic has tended to skew younger. And of
course, that's the conversation on expanding the market, which I think
we can all appreciate. But I'm wondering how you think about Fortnite
sort of continuing to develop when you look at sort of the semi-dynamic maps
that are happening and the licensing that's also happening for some of
the short-term events like they did with Marvel. If you feel -- or concerned
at that sort of young demographic could begin to skew older, and of course,
that would be a concern only to -- because it seems to be where you found
some safety, I guess, on the traditional shooter IP that skews to an older
audience.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: In fact, we have to consider that what we do is to
create an entertainment experience that is as fantastic as possible. And all
those ideas, we also have in our games. And we like to see what other
companies are doing, but we feel that they -- there are lots of opportunities
in expanding the success of our games, and what we must consider is the
business is large. We shouldn't lose the fact that you have Minecraft,
you have League of Legends, you have plenty of games also in the industry,
and so they have plenty of room if we can bring good experience with high
quality that will entertain players the way they want. What is good is that
the industry and the consumption of games is changing regularly. But our job
is to make sure we adapt and we create new types of experiences that people
will want to play.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  OPERATOR: We'll go next to Charles Scotti of Kepler.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  CHARLES-LOUIS SCOTTI, RESEARCH ANALYST, KEPLER CHEUVREUX, RESEARCH
DIVISION: A couple of questions on my side. The first one is you're all
moving very fast in your digital transformation. What level of PRI can you
reasonably expect as a percentage of sales in the midterm? What are your
internal target? And what is the associated profitability? The second
question is on the recently leaked from one map that seems to indicate the
release of the Splinter Cell in Assassin's Creed. Can you give us a
little bit more information about that? And the third question is on treasury
shares. What is the level of treasury shares at the end of the year? And what
do you intend to do with them next year?
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: So on the games to come, we can't comment on
rumors, so you won't get more information from us today.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ALAIN MARTINEZ: Yes. And regarding the PRI, what we are -- what
we've been saying for quite a while is that we are seeing that our
competition is at 40% of some -- over 40%. So we felt that having a
medium-term goal of reaching this 40% was something that we should try to
shoot for. What we are very happy is that if you look at the progress made in
3 years, it's been outstanding. So we don't want to say that in a
couple of years, we would be at 40%. But clearly, it's not something
that cannot be imagined. But we're working on that, and we need to go
and do step-by-step.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: And what's important to consider is that
it's going to come from the fact that our games will be played longer,
so it means more content supplied to players so that they can play more in
our games. So we -- the route we are taking, the path we are taking is really
to make sure our games last longer based on the quality of the experience so
that when people play and they see, they can buy new elements, they can do
it, or buy new items or new content. That is really the way we want to
increase our PRI.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ALAIN MARTINEZ: Oh, treasury share, sorry. So as it is today, as
we were mentioning, we have 1.4% of shares that we bought in first half of
fiscal year '18. That treasury shares will be canceled once we have done
our latest employee shareholder plan, so they will more or less compensate
with the new share created by our employee. And in return, as we mentioned,
we will have EUR 100 million. On top of that, as we said, we bought some 4.5
million shares from Vivendi. They are within the contract with the bank with
a firm commitment to be purchased within a 3-year period, but they are
immediately taken away from our number of shares. This is why we have
mentioned today that our number of shares for fiscal year '19 will be
118 million, so that includes already what we have firmly, and on the binding
side, committed. Plus on top of that, as we mentioned also, we have a EUR 200
million agreement with a bank, and that agreement goes both ways, either we
can decide to buy the shares, which is, in fact, the intent, but we have the
freedom to decide to cash in the difference if the share has gone up. So
potentially, those EUR 200 million of shares, which amounts to something like
3 million plus of shares, could be new treasury shares that would be added up
to the one that we already have. Am I clear?
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  CHARLES-LOUIS SCOTTI: Yes, very clear.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  OPERATOR: We'll go next to Asen Kostadinov of Barclays.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ASEN KOSTADINOV, RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH
DIVISION: Regarding mobile revenues, you're at 5% in fiscal year
'18. What is your target for fiscal year '19? And is that going to
be mainly coming from organic growth? Or do you expect to have any material
acquisitions in the next fiscal year?
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ALAIN MARTINEZ: So based on the acquisition we already made, we --
our objective for this year is to reach EUR 140 million. So it's over
40% growth versus last year. And as we mentioned, this is based -- a big part
of it is related to the acquisition we made in the last 18 months. That
doesn't include any further acquisition that we might do during fiscal
year '19.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ASEN KOSTADINOV: Can you just repeat the number again? Was it EUR
440 million, is it? That seems too [high].
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  ALAIN MARTINEZ: No, no, no, EUR 140 million. EUR 140 million.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  OPERATOR: And we have no further questions at this time.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  YVES GUILLEMOT: Okay. So thank you very much for spending the time
today with us, and have a good day or a good evening. Thank you. Bye-bye
then.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  OPERATOR: That does concludes our conference for today. We thank
you for your participation. You may now disconnect.
