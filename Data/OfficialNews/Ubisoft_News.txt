<p >"We are all super-excited to bring such an iconic character as Sam Fisher into Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands," says Nouredine Abboud, Senior Producer, Ubisoft Paris. "Teaming up with Sam Fisher will require the Ghosts' stealth, cleverness and tactics. We can't wait to see the reactions of our players as they face this new challenge!"</p>
<p >In addition to this special crossover event, <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/article/ghost-recon-wildlands-year-2-content-begins-april-10">Special Operations I</a> will introduce a new Echelon assault class to Ghost Recon Wildlands' Ghost War PVP mode. As you might expect, the Echelon class is a part of Sam's Fourth Echelon team, giving them access to fancy gadgetry, like the Sonar Pulse that enables them to see enemies through walls at close range. Echelon will be available for purchase with Prestige points or via the Ghost Recon Wildlands Year 2 Pass which will grant owners seven-day early access to the class ahead of non-pass owners. The class will also be available for use in Sabotage, a new PvP game mode included in the free update that also introduces five exclusive new maps.</p>

标题：The Division – Looking Back on 2 Years of Live Operations 	 时间：2018-04-06T09:00:00 	 内容：<p >When The Division launched in March 2016, it sold more copies in its first 24 hours than any other game in Ubisoft history, and broke company sales records on all platforms. This massive success was not without its pitfalls, however; a few months after launch, internal reports showed that player satisfaction with the game was trending downward. But now, two years after launch, player sentiment is higher than it's ever been. We talked to Fredrik Brönjemark, Online &amp; Live Operations Director at Massive Entertainment, about this impressive comeback and how the team made it happen. </p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/ubisoft/ubisoft-news/news/images/axe-me-a-q_960x540_321671.jpg" title="axe-me-a-q_960x540" alt="axe-me-a-q_960x540"  xlink:title="axe-me-a-q_960x540" />
<br /></p>
<p >The first step towards getting things back on track was to determine what problems were causing players the most consternation. "It was bugs, of course," reflected Brönjemark, "but it was also performance issues, stability issues, and connectivity issues. And so it was all centered around quality and stability, primarily." </p>
<p >But knowing is only half the battle. If the team could see the declining sentiment, why hadn't they already addressed the problems? "The reason why we really didn't act on it was because the schedule was already so packed with content. [Having] developers working on several different threads of development at the same time really meant that there was no time to take a break and really look at, okay, these are the things players are talking about, these are the things we need to address." </p>
<p >This was a tough time for the team. The developers could see the negativity building in the community, but game development schedules are determined years in advance, and affect a broad cross-section of teams. This makes them difficult to adjust, and Brönjemark recalled the daunting prospect of putting DLC development on pause: "Initially, there was definitely a fear that pushing <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/article/division-survival-expansion-1-5-update-incoming">Survival</a> and <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/article/division-last-stand-expansion-need-know">Last Stand</a> out would really have an impact. But, you know, what we all concluded was [that] letting the sentiment remain as it is and not addressing it now is going to have a much more serious impact than pushing these two updates out." When they made the decision to prioritize updates focused on the health of the game, the team was glad to finally have the bandwidth to focus on the most urgent need and immediately got to work.</p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/ubisoft/ubisoft-news/news/images/git-hunted_960x513_321673.jpg" title="git-hunted_960x513" alt="git-hunted_960x513"  xlink:title="git-hunted_960x513" />
<br /></p>
<p >Even though the tide had turned internally, the fixes the team had in mind weren't going to appear overnight. They still had an increasingly dissatisfied player population to consider. Addressing that sentiment head-on fell to the community development team, and in a candid livestream, they laid out the issues they were seeing, told players they understood what they were experiencing, and resolved to do something about it. "That was really tough," Brönjemark said, "but it was also a super important turning point, because that's when we also started to win over the community. The acknowledgment that we were open and that we were listening was really what the community needed to hear at that point."</p>
<p >The next step was emblematic of the team's belief that communication is a two-way street. Massive's community team proposed inviting players who invested a lot of time in the game and were active in the community to come to Malmö, Sweden (home of Massive Entertainment) for a special event. Dubbed the Elite Task Force (ETF), this group of players brought a wealth of in-game expertise to the table. "It's difficult to compete with someone who has 1,400 hours into the game," Brönjemark said. "They're going to know the details of min/maxing a bit better than you are. It's just impossible to compete with that." And indeed, the point of the event was not competition, but collaboration. </p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/ubisoft/ubisoft-news/news/images/hot-boys_960x557_321674.jpg" title="hot-boys_960x557" alt="hot-boys_960x557"  xlink:title="hot-boys_960x557" />
<br /></p>
<p >First, the team asked the ETF members what changes they wanted to see in the game. Then, the team revealed their plans to the ETF and found that the two sets of goals lined up very closely. The group then proceeded to work through more of the nitty gritty details, combining their expertise and experience. Not only did the ETF help shape future updates, but they also brought their contributions and experience with the development team back to the community. "They've met the developers, so they have a personal connection, and they've been part of giving feedback to an update," said Brönjemark. "[It] makes them really proud about talking positively about the game, because they've given something into the process, right? I think that's really strong, that's one of the really key strengths of the Elite Task Force initiative."</p>
<p >Connecting with the community was a key part of the team's plan to improve player sentiment. The other part was to evolve their development process for the future. Knowing how important it was to get each update right, they developed a solution that would add another layer of assurance: the <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/article/division-public-test-server-launches-today">Public Test</a> Server. By inviting players first on PC, then later on consoles, to download and play a separate game client, they could test their changes on a small, engaged audience before releasing them to the masses. The results were encouraging: "It's really been a super-strong tool from a development perspective, catching issues, exploits, these kinds of things early," said Brönjemark. "And making sure that we don't expose the entire community to those things, but only the relatively small number of players that actually take part in the PTS. Again, these are players that want to help; they want to be part of the development, so they're really happy to test something and give feedback."</p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/ubisoft/ubisoft-news/news/images/big-boat_960x526_321672.jpg" title="big-boat_960x526" alt="big-boat_960x526"  xlink:title="big-boat_960x526" />
<br /></p>
<p >As The Division teams implemented and supported these initiatives, they continued to communicate regularly with players in order to keep them up-to-date. So when did they start seeing results? "We got a very clear indication almost immediately that it was working. Sentiment went up higher than it was at the launch when we did <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/article/division-1-4-patch-ushers-sweeping-fixes-tweaks">Update 1.4</a>, and then throughout Year 2 we've seen it stabilize and then just continue to increase and it's now at an all-time high in the history of the game," said Brönjemark. </p>
<p >The Division is still going strong, recently surpassing the <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/article/the-division-celebrates-two-years-and-20-million-players-with-new-global-events">20-million-player mark</a> and continuing to entice players in with new challenges and new rewards. But how has the comeback of The Division been influencing the development of The Division 2? Brönjemark says, "The team developing the Division 2 is the same team that's been working on the first game, so all of these experiences, all of these learnings, we're bringing with us to The Division 2."</p>
<p >The Division is available now on PC, Xbox One, and PS4. For more on the latest in-game events and news about The Division 2, check out <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/category/the-division">our previous coverage</a>. </p> 
标题：New Ubisoft Studio Opening in Winnipeg 	 时间：2018-04-06T08:00:00 	 内容：<p >A new Ubisoft studio is coming to <a href="http://winnipeg.ubisoft.com/">Winnipeg</a>, Manitoba, joining the Ubisoft Canadian Studios collective of AAA development teams in Montreal, Quebec City, Saguenay, and Toronto.

标题：Far Cry 5 Breaks Franchise Sales Records 	 时间：2018-04-04T09:00:00 	 内容：<p >Ubisoft announced that Far Cry 5 more than doubled first week sell-through of Far Cry 4, making Far Cry 5 the fastest selling title in the franchise's history. Digital distribution accounted for more than 50 percent of those sales. Far Cry 5 now represents the second biggest launch ever for a Ubisoft game, following only Tom Clancy's The Division, with $310M USD in consumer spending through the first week.  </p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/ubisoft/ubisoft-news/news/images/fc5_infographic_stats_week1_en_321552.jpg" title="FC5_Infographic_Stats_Week1_EN" alt="FC5_Infographic_Stats_Week1_EN"  xlink:title="FC5_Infographic_Stats_Week1_EN" />
<br /></p>
<p >In addition to the strong first week of sales, record-breaking numbers of people are engaging with Far Cry 5 content. People streamed more than 55,000 hours of Far Cry 5 on Twitch and YouTubers' videos earned more than 117 million views.  Both are records for a Ubisoft title in a week following launch, and evidence of the impact user generated content is having in convincing players to join the Far Cry community.</p>
<p >"Far Cry 5, like the real Montana, is a vast and gorgeous playground filled with colorful stories for players to enjoy and share," Laurent Detoc, President of Ubisoft, Americas. "We're grateful to newcomers and fans of the series who have joined us in Hope County and have collectively grown our community."</p>
<p >Set in America, a first for the franchise, Far Cry 5 offers players total freedom to navigate a serene-looking yet deeply twisted world as the new junior deputy of fictional Hope County, Montana. Players will find that their arrival accelerates a years-long silent coup by a fanatical doomsday cult, the Project at Eden's Gate, igniting a violent takeover of the county. Under siege and cut off from the rest of the world, players will join forces with residents of Hope County and form the Resistance.</p>
<p >"I'm proud that the culmination of years of passionate work from the team is paying off, and that Far Cry 5's experience resonates with so many people," said Dan Hay, Executive Producer on Far Cry. "We are humbled by players' reception of Far Cry 5 and fired up to keep growing and supporting the Far Cry community in the months and years to come."</p>
<p >Far Cry 5 is now available on PS4, Xbox One, and PC. For more information on the game, check <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/category/far-cry-5">out our previous coverage</a>.</p> 
标题：Women of Ubisoft – Liz England 	 时间：2018-04-03T14:00:00 	 内容：<p >The first words I hear Liz England say at the Xbox Women in Gaming Rally are, "Oh, I'm not good at shooters either, but I still love them. Don't let that stop you." England is speaking to an attendee of her "Gaming for Everyone" talk, in which she and a peer are discussing design inclusivity. The remark is emblematic of the kind of person England is: someone who recognizes and embraces her passions, and refuses to let anything keep her from them. </p>
<p >As a game designer, England is responsible for building the systems that make games dynamic and fun. While level designers sculpt environments and decide how to populate games, England and her team design systems that dictate how the game is played by deciding things like how the player moves, how they interact with enemies, how quests work, or how characters level up. </p>
<p >Growing up in upstate New York, England initially studied Medieval English literature. Afraid she might not find a welcoming job market, she enrolled in a Master's program in game design at Southern Methodist University in Texas. After graduating, England worked at 5th Cell and Insomniac Games before joining Ubisoft two years ago. An Assassin's Creed fan since her first Leap of Faith, England is particularly fond of the Ezio trilogy, mostly because of her experience exploring Italy herself a few years before the launch of Assassin's Creed II. </p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/ubisoft/ubisoft-news/news/images/ubisofttoronto-exterior_960x639_321513.jpg" title="UbisoftToronto-Exterior_960x639" alt="UbisoftToronto-Exterior_960x639"  xlink:title="UbisoftToronto-Exterior_960x639" />
<br /></p>
<p ><strong>Was there a specific moment when you realized you wanted to work in games? </strong></p>
<p ><strong>Liz England:</strong> The first time I thought, "maybe I want to make games" was when I was 14, playing my first Final Fantasy game. I was watching the gorgeous cutscenes, and I thought, "I want to make this!" The first time I ever became aware of what a designer actually does was when I was playing Ratchet &amp; Clank when I was 16. There were so many cool mechanics and aspects to those games, and I thought, "I want to design something like this." </p>
<p >It's funny, because the first time I ever used an editor to create game content, I was only 10 years old and it was for Heroes of Might &amp; Magic. The game came with a level editor, and I used to go in and give myself a whole bunch of black dragons, and then slowly over time I began editing the maps themselves. Eventually, I just started making my own maps. It's weird because I had been doing it at such a young age, but I had never thought that it could be an actual job. </p>
<p ><strong>Why do you think you're good at what you do? </strong></p>
<p ><strong>LE:</strong> I'm not entirely sure why I'm good at it. A piece of advice a friend gave me a while ago was, "find what's easy and do that." What she meant by that is find something that's easy for you, but hard for everyone else. That way you can complete a task faster and easier than someone else, and then elevate it to the next level. I think identifying that thing that fit me was key to my career. I really enjoy looking at complex problems that have a lot of ties to a lot of systems. I like to look at all those connections and balance them out together into a cohesive whole. I like thinking about how one thing can affect all this other stuff, that's why I like open world games so much. </p>
<p ><strong>Why did you want to give this "Games for Everyone" talk? </strong></p>
<p ><strong>LE:</strong> I'm not a UI/UX designer, I don't necessarily work in accessibility. What I do, however, is look at the kind of content and the game that we're creating and think about in what ways are we excluding players and including players. How are we excluding players, and how can we remove those barriers? From a content standpoint, from a game-design standpoint, we make a lot of small decisions based on our biases, like "we play games all the time." Our audience is much wider than that, they're much more diverse than I am. I can only represent one person. "Games for Everyone" is a good way to think about how I can look at the game I'm making and see what kind of assumptions am I making that are the wrong type of assumptions. It helps you take a step back and think: What are we really doing and representing in this game? Are we leaving people out because we're not like those people? </p>
<p >Poor representation is a usability issue, and as a game designer, I know how to tackle usability issues. You start doing playtests, you gather feedback, you start to iterate and make changes. I feel like you can do that when it comes to representation in games or accessibility features. It's difficult to do that when you're worrying about all these other things, like how to make a game fun, but they're important considerations. </p>
<p ><strong>Why do you think there's such a large gender equity gap in game development? </strong></p>
<p ><strong>LE:</strong> It was actually a strange experience for me when I went to game development school, because before that, I was an English major. English literature programs typically skew female, and then I showed up at game school, and there were only two other women. </p>
<p >I think there are a lot of reasons. I like to point out the phrase "leaky pipeline," because I think it embodies the problem as a whole. A lot of people say it's just about getting girls interested early on, and that is part of it, but the leaky pipeline is meant to signify that every step of the way, people can be left out or can fall through the cracks. That kind of thing happens a lot to women. I was lucky to grow up with a family where gaming was universal. But as I got older, my brother was typecast as the "computer person," and I was typecast as the "books and art" person, so he got a computer in his bedroom and I didn't. That was a point where I could have easily slipped through the leaky pipeline.</p>
<p >I think another problem is that there aren't a lot of role models for women. If you don't have early experiences with female role models and women in games, it can be difficult to see yourself in it. There are a lot of little steps along that way when people can feel excluded, or even just don't feel included, and that all creates that pipeline issue. When you add all the little things together, that's where you get the major disparity.  </p>
<p ><strong>Do you think representation within games has anything to do with it? </strong></p>
<p ><strong>LE:</strong> Probably. I know for me it wasn't so much of an issue, because I grew up on adventure games that often had women as protagonists, so I actually felt well represented. But there were always games that I felt weren't for me, games with a lot of violence and weird power fantasies. I think there's a lot of gender disparity in a lot of the fantasies we expect of a player. Even now, I gravitate to games where the power fantasy is more social, like romance games, or games where you manipulate people socially. </p>
<p >More recently, I find myself less interested in a game if it doesn't have good representation and a diverse cast. There's so many games I could be playing; why would I play something with a character I've played 20 times before, when I could play something new? </p>

<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 1em; margin-top: -55px;" >Credit: Techvibes</p>
<p ><strong>Have you ever had any female or non-binary role models? </strong></p>
<p ><strong>LE:</strong> Yes, but I won't name them, because they're all my friends now (laughs). One of the reasons I like the Xbox Women in Gaming Rally is that you can meet women you look up to and form relationships with them. There's an added element to the connections you make with women that share your same interests that is different from connections you make with men who share your same interests. I have a lot of life-long "career buddies" that I used to admire, and then realized we had similar interests. </p>
<p ><strong>What advice would you give to young women who want to do what you do? </strong></p>
<p ><strong>LE:</strong> Well, I have negative advice and positive advice (laughs). </p>
<p ><strong>What's negative advice? </strong></p>
<p ><strong>LE:</strong> So there's a big difference culturally between the game industry and gamers. A lot of students in school bring gamer culture with them. There's an attitude in gamer culture that's unprofessional, and there's a way of talking about games and understanding games that's different for people in the industry versus just someone who plays games.</p>
<p >Women can feel isolated in gamer culture, whereas the game industry culture is a lot more professional and welcoming. I find myself respected in ways among game developers that I might not be among gamer consumer culture. I think for a lot of students going through school, they're not in game developer culture yet, and it can feel like a major turnoff. There's a lot of questioning of whether that person belongs there or not. I find the game industry is a lot friendlier than that, no one really gets mad if I say I don't play many AAA games. </p>
<p ><strong>So what's the positive advice? </strong></p>
<p ><strong>LE:</strong> It can be hard to get into games, and there's not really a formula for it. But we're in a time where there is an abundance of tools and ways in which you can make your own games or art. There are plenty of ways to develop the skill necessary to work in the games industry. It's a hard industry to get into and it's very competitive, but there are a lot of paths in. My advice would be to make games. Make games that speak to you, and put them on itch.io. You don't have to make super-large games, you don't need a degree, you can get all this experience in a way that I wasn't able to when I was in school. There's a democratization of game-development tools, and it's becoming more and more accessible to make stuff. There's no excuse to not make a game if that's what you want to do, and the best part is that as you create, you'll learn what your favorite part of development is. </p>
<p ><strong>What does the Xbox Women in Gaming Rally mean to you?</strong></p>
<p ><strong>LE:</strong> I value the ability to go to a place where there are a lot of women and allies and connect with people who on some level have a certain amount of shared cultural experience. Because there are so few women in the industry, it can feel isolating at times, and I often rely on the Women in Gaming events for opportunities to connect with more women. I've met people today that I'll probably talk to for years. </p>

标题：Looking Back on 10 Years of Assassin's Creed 	 时间：2018-03-29T14:00:00 	 内容：<p >Assassin's Creed Origins was the culmination of 10 years of learning, innovation, and evolution that grew the Assassin's Creed series from a single game into a massive multimedia franchise. Origins' creative director, Jean Guesdon (who also directed Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag), has been with the franchise almost since it began, joining the original Assassin's Creed team during its last year of production in 2006. At the 2018 Game Developer's Conference, Guesdon took the stage to reflect on the series' successes, its missteps, and how far it's come over the past decade, beginning with the creation of the first Assassin's Creed.</p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/10years_321294.jpg" title="10years" alt="10years"  xlink:title="10years" />
<br /></p>
<p ><strong>Defining the Brand</strong></p>
<p >"Back in 2004... the team behind Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time got the mandate to prepare for [Xbox 360 and PS3], and to also reinvent the action-adventure genre," Guesdon says. Over time, their ideas for a new Prince of Persia evolved into something that was faster, edgier, and more grounded in reality than Prince of Persia's fantasy setting. There was a push toward something more mature, something focused on modernity and realism while presenting a new kind of take on the Middle Ages. </p>
<p >"One important [decision] was to have a more realistic treatment, and to accept the M-rating," says Guesdon. "This was not the case with [Prince of Persia]. This was a big step forward, also. And with this realistic treatment came the present day [setting]. The reason behind the present day in the first place is to create relatedness between the audience and the setting."</p>
<p >Assassin's Creed's present-day storyline, which revolved around protagonist Desmond Miles reliving an ancestor's genetic memories in an ultramodern lab, balanced the medieval action with DNA imagery and synthetic stylishness, creating something unlike anything that came before. At the same time, other stylistic elements emerged that would become hallmarks of the series, not the least of which were the beaked hoods and eagle-related names of the series' protagonists. The association with eagles is more than cosmetic, says Guesdon; it's visible "even [in] the posing of Altair, and in this notion that the Assassin is really dominating the situation. He is overlooking the world from above, ready to strike whenever he wants."</p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/eagle_321291.jpg" title="eagle" alt="eagle"  xlink:title="eagle" />
<br /></p>
<p >Among the breakthroughs of the first game was the creation of its open world, through which players could freely parkour in ways that had only really been attempted in Prince of Persia's more linear platforming levels. This was no mean feat, and it pushed the developers to create new technology, the Anvil engine, to render the game's highly interactive cities, photorealistic architecture, and crowded streets.</p>
<p >"When you develop the engine at the same time you develop the content, there is a risk," says Guesdon. "Builds are not stable enough, so you cannot properly develop the gameplay and the full experience." When the game arrived in stores, says Guesdon, it met with immediate success – but also heavy criticism. "We had mixed reviews, because we were lacking of things to do," says Guesdon. "There was too much repetitiveness. Some of the journalists even said, 'is it just a tech demo?' ... We really needed [Assassin's Creed II] to deliver the full promise of what Assassin's Creed was."</p>
<p ><strong>Refining the Formula</strong></p>
<p >In creating Assassin's Creed II, Guesdon says, the team's mandate was straightforward, but extremely challenging: replicate the success of the first Assassin's Creed, while also fixing all of its problems. "We thoroughly analyzed Assassin's Creed, doing a postmortem," he says. "What we realized was that the actual missions of Assassin's Creed 1 were not asking players to do what they were enjoying. We were asking you to sit on a bench and pickpocket guys, while when you were playing alone, you just liked to parkour, to fight, and to blend. This was the first learning that helped shape Assassin's Creed II. We identified our three main gameplay pillars: the fight, the navigation, and the social stealth. And the entire game was designed around these pillars."</p>
<p >The specialized guards you faced in Assassin's Creed II – the Brutes, Agiles, and Seekers – were each designed to challenge you on one of the three pillars, while the mercenaries, thieves, and courtesans you could hire each bolstered a particular pillar. "So in the end, all the design loops were focused on actually supporting and making players use these pillars," says Guesdon.</p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/ac2_s_008_321296.jpg" title="AC2_S_008" alt="AC2_S_008"  xlink:title="AC2_S_008" />
<br /></p>
<p >Assassin's Creed II is also where the series' multilayered narrative began to really take shape, with a bigger focus on the First Civilization and the centuries-long conspiracy behind the Templars. The developers also took a more involved approach to history, working with historians in an effort to bring the Italian Renaissance to life. </p>
<p >"When talking about history, it's not about... a very old engraving of a very old man," says Guesdon, pointing to a picture of an ancient, bearded Leonardo da Vinci. "The Leonardo da Vinci that you meet in the game is this young, petulant, and very dynamic man. And we think like that – we were giving players the joy, the excitement to live history, to be part of it." </p>
<p >With just two years to create the game, the developers had to change the way they worked, collaborating with multiple Ubisoft studios to shoulder different aspects of the game. Ubisoft Annecy developed the city-building management sim in Monteriggioni, while the then-new Singapore studio created the secret locations players could discover and parkour through. A second team in Montreal, meanwhile, added some of the game's more exotic moments, such as the da Vinci glider mission and the mountain carriage chase. This cross-studio collaboration would become instrumental in the series' development going forward.</p>
<p ><strong>Keeping It Fresh</strong></p>
<p >"If we talk about yearly releases, it only could be done working with multiple core teams," says Guesdon. "I'm not talking about multiple teams collaborating on one game. This was a brand-new thing. It was big. It was actually having multiple core teams working in parallel. If you look at the first core team, the original one that made AC1, they were behind ACII, also." </p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/teams_321292.jpg" title="teams" alt="teams"  xlink:title="teams" />
<br /></p>
<p >So while that team went on to create Assassin's Creed Brotherhood in 2010, Guesdon says, a second core team in Montreal began work on Assassin's Creed III. Then, in 2011, as the first team began work on Assassin's Creed Unity, a third team was formed to develop Assassin's Creed Revelations. </p>
<p >In addition to these core teams, multiple supporting teams worked to create specific aspects of each game – and if those aspects weren't working out, the compartmentalized approach would make it easier to cut or alter them. And in the midst of all this collaboration and parallel development, the teams had one overriding goal: "Each game had the mandate to stay fresh, to bring something new to the franchise and to the gamers," says Guesdon.</p>
<p >In Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, that meant the addition of the Brotherhood – which let players recruit and summon Assassins into combat – and multiplayer, while Revelations added the hookblade and Desmond's modern-day "Animus Limbo" segments. From Assassin's Creed III's wilderness and Black Flag's seamless naval world to Unity's co-op and Syndicate's dual protagonists, each new installment brought something original to make it unique.</p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/acs_sc_pc_01_jacobevie_1447799908_321297.jpg" title="ACS_SC_PC_01_JacobEvie_1447799908" alt="ACS_SC_PC_01_JacobEvie_1447799908"  xlink:title="ACS_SC_PC_01_JacobEvie_1447799908" />
<br /></p>
<p >"Some of them lasted, for example the naval [exploration], some of them didn't – think about the tower-defense Templar stuff in Revelations," says Guesdon. "But the idea was to try, to always try. Even if we knew the global structure, every single game brought something [new] to the players and the franchise." </p>
<p >The series' narrative also got a shake-up with Assassin's Creed III, which brought the Desmond storyline to a close. "[Desmond's story] was really important, because it was the glue between all the episodes, all of the first games. It was connecting time periods that had nothing to do with another... but at some point, it was really becoming constraining," says Guesdon. "We wanted... to be able to put the audience at the center of our universe. Our vision behind that was... when Desmond saved the world, the real world and our fictitious world were colliding. Since then, the present day of Assassin's Creed is our real world. We wanted players to actually be part of this universe."</p>
<p >Instead of Desmond and his genetically preordained destiny, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag introduced Abstergo Entertainment, which Guesdon describes as a way to make genetic memories accessible to everyone. Its present-day protagonist was meant to be the player, who experienced the story from a first-person perspective. The idea was expanded in Assassin's Creed Unity, with the player contacted by the Assassins through Abstergo Entertainment's Helix device – and with Unity, Guesdon says, the series hit a snag. </p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/assassins_creed_unity_coop_iconic_1415412400_321299.jpg" title="Assassins_Creed_Unity_COOP_Iconic_1415412400" alt="Assassins_Creed_Unity_COOP_Iconic_1415412400"  xlink:title="Assassins_Creed_Unity_COOP_Iconic_1415412400" />
<br /></p>
<p > "If you remember Assassin's Creed 1, [Unity] had some similarities, because there was a lot of work being done at a very low level in terms of tech," says Guesdon. "The engine was massively revamped, with some fantastic rendering things. Today, Unity is still one of the best-looking games ever. But at the same time, we moved to a one-to-one scale [world] that had an impact on the navigation, and so the gameplay was affected. We fell again into this trap of working a lot on the tech, and not allowing the teams that create the content [enough freedom] to actually come up with something new."</p>
<p >This, Guesdon says, created "the perfect conditions for the perfect storm," leading to a game that was visually polished but lacking in gameplay innovations. It also initially required that certain content be unlocked with the Initiates website and app, which wasn't well received.</p>
<p >"Having content locked in the game that was asking you to do things on the website, people were like, 'What's that for, exactly? Are you kidding?'" says Guesdon. "In short, we probably flew too close to the sun. We were a bit overconfident. And this is why Syndicate had to really focus on quality, which the team did very, very well."</p>
<p ><strong>A New Beginning</strong></p>
<p >When development began on Assassin's Creed Origins in 2014, it was clear that the series was due for a "big-league refresh," Guesdon says. "The four big directions I gave to the team were: We need to show that we mastered open-world creation. We need to find a better if not perfect balance between story and player. We need to be a not-skippable episode in the AC universe, and to remain a connected game, even without co-op. We need to show that being part of the community brings value to your overall experience. We are not a competitive franchise, but the community's very strong, and we need to leverage that."</p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/acoteams_321289.jpg" title="ACOteams" alt="ACOteams"  xlink:title="ACOteams" />
<br /></p>
<p >The goal was to give players more freedom than any previous Assassin's Creed, building interwoven systems that players could experiment with to create their own fun – luring predatory animals into bandit camps, for example, or using carefully laid oil pots and a torch-lit arrow to trap enemy soldiers in a surprise inferno. To make this more achievable, the developers pursued what Guesdon describes as an "archipelago" structure, with a procedurally generated world filled with handcrafted "islands" of content – the cities, landmarks, and noteworthy geography of Ancient Egypt. </p>
<p >"It's good to have a big world, but we needed to fill it in a meaningful way," says Guesdon. That next step involved the creation of global artificial intelligence to govern the world's inhabitants. "Think about it as a [real-time strategy] AI set on top of an open-world game, where people have their [own] agenda," says Guesdon. This helped create a believable world that could also bring together the game's overlapping systems – governing fire, weather, predatory animals, physics, hostile bandits, and so on – to create emergent situations the developers hadn't originally envisioned. Along the same lines, the fighting moved from a system of paired animations – locking the player and an enemy into pre-animated sequences depending on whether, say, a hit landed or was blocked – to hitboxes, creating more openness and versatility in how players and enemies approached combat. </p>
<p >"It was a cultural shift for the developers, not just a technological one," says Guesdon. "We kept repeating to the team, we should focus on the experience, and not the scripting or hard coding. Players don't care about our coding, they just care about their experience. We needed to understand that losing a bit of control would bring more fun to the players, rather than creating issues."</p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/1stciv_321293.jpg" title="1stciv" alt="1stciv"  xlink:title="1stciv" />
<br /></p>
<p >The changes would be deeper than a more dynamic world, though. A big question the team had to keep asking itself was which elements Assassin's Creed Origins should keep, and which ones it should change. Huge buildings were rare in Ancient Egypt, so climbing became more focused on cliffs and mountains, gradually expanding to nearly any vertical surface in the game world. Viewpoints and Leaps of Faith were kept, but the mechanic of using them to unfog the world map was removed, because it "was feeling very old," Guesdon says. </p>
<p >Another iconic element that needed a change, says Guesdon, was the Hidden Blade, which he describes as "the nuclear weapon of Assassins," and which was getting in the way of character progression. If players can kill anything with one Hidden Blade strike, the team realized, they won't care about raising their level or upgrading their weapons. The social stealth, meanwhile, was removed entirely, because it didn't make as much sense for Bayek's character. "He's not per se an Assassin, he's more proto-Assassin, more of a warrior," Guesdon says. "It doesn't make any real sense to have him with big axes hiding among civilians. So we decided to focus instead on environmental stealth."</p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/blending_321290.jpg" title="blending" alt="blending"  xlink:title="blending" />
<br /></p>
<p >Assassin's Creed Origins capped off a first decade largely defined by collaboration, with each Assassin's Creed bringing together multiple creative forces to try new things, improve whatever didn't work previously, and give each installment in the series a unique identity. "You need to be able to adapt to opportunities or issues, and remain open, so you can work with others that will bring you solutions," says Guesdon, "It's this constant flux between solidity – not stiffness – and flexibility."</p> 
标题：Star Trek: Bridge Crew – Ever Wonder What Warp Speed Smells Like? 	 时间：2018-03-28T10:00:00 	 内容：<p >Whether in VR or just on a normal screen, <em>Star Trek Bridge Crew</em> gives you an opportunity to live out the sci-fi dream of serving aboard a Federation Starship bridge, facing seemingly insurmountable odds while taking on the role of captain, engineer, tactical officer, or helm. Now, if you visit the <em>Star Trek: Bridge Crew</em> Rescue at Perseph experience at an IMAX VR Center, you'll experience a whole new layer of immersion, as certain on-screen actions will cause distinct smells to be pumped into the room. What are these smells, you might ask? That was the first question we had when we spoke to Maxence Moutte, Creative Perfumer at Givaudan, to learn more about what you'll be smelling and how those unique scents came to be. </p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/stbc_enterprise_exterior13_1492799337_321196.png" title="STBC_Enterprise_exterior13_1492799337" alt="STBC_Enterprise_exterior13_1492799337"  xlink:title="STBC_Enterprise_exterior13_1492799337" />
<br /></p>
<p ><strong>What is the process for determining and creating a scent in general?</strong></p>
<p >Creating a scent, like any creative work – and design in general – starts from an idea. Could it be an olfactive direction or scent association, for instance mint plus fig, plus the idea of a soft and warm texture? Could it be an illustration from another sense, like music, a texture, an image or film? Is it a concept? Abstract or concrete? Getting the precise idea of where you want to go is sometimes the most difficult part of the job... even though sometimes, the idea gets more precise during the creative work. It can also be a very intimate and individual process, as it can also be a shared work. I can enjoy working as a duet where sensitivities combine [with] each other and enrich each other.</p>
<p ><strong>What makes smell such a tricky thing to get right?</strong></p>
<p >Sense of smell is very intimate and individualistic, because we do not receive an olfactory education! We are taught colors – this is blue; this is red. We are taught music – listening, singing, or playing an instrument. But we are not taught how to describe a smell, to analyze the smell around us, pay attention to it, and to get a common language. Therefore, we are left with personal memories and underestimate the power of smell in our life. What about the alert-signal smell of "off" food, or a fire? What about the power of re-smelling the fragrance that a beloved one wore years ago?</p>
<p >Neuroreceptors from our nose are directly connected to the part of our brain dedicated to emotions. No wonder we can get so emotional with smells! Designing a scent that evokes the same thing to several individuals, and to different cultures, is indeed very tricky. Luckily, there are some quite global scents despite some very cultural ones.</p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/moodboard speed_321195.jpg" title="moodboard speed" alt="moodboard speed"  xlink:title="moodboard speed" />
<br /></p>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 1em; margin-top: -55px;" >Mood Boards were used by the team to develop scents</p>
<p ><strong>What does Warp speed smell like? How did you arrive at that scent?</strong></p>
<p >Warp speed smells a combination of cold-smelling notes – a bit of freezing mint that gives you the impression that your face is frozen by the speed, along with hot-smelling notes such as labdanum resin that illustrate the heat of the engine while at full speed.</p>
<p ><strong>What about Impact? </strong></p>
<p >Impact smells like a fireball hitting a metal vessel. There is a metallic, rosy note that occurs naturally in fragrant geranium, called pelargonium; it's burning and slightly burnt, [and combined with] burnt wood of cade, and, again, labdanum resin. This is an alert scent, a warning that a danger has arrived and there is no time to lose. </p>
<p ><strong>How much involvement did the Ubisoft teams have? Were they able to influence the scents?</strong></p>
<p >We worked closely with Ubisoft New Business and the <em>Star Trek</em> team to identify the key moments of the games that could be enhanced with scents. We gave them a first round of 10 fragrances that we smelled together and discussed through. Among those 10, four were kept to be reworked to be closer to what they imagined for the game. We had to all be aligned to make sure we would deliver scents that would both appeal to players and match with the gameplay.</p>
<p ><strong>Were there any moments when you definitely knew you had the wrong scent?</strong></p>
<p >It is very easy to see if you have the wrong fragrance. No one dares to speak, but everyone's face looks wrong or skeptical. Fragrances have to illustrate precise places and moments in the game, so they had to be easy to understand, and be appealing and pleasant. Luckily, I had the chance to immerse myself in the game and to explore the player experience. This helped me a lot in determining what could be impactful while playing.</p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/moodboard impact_321194.jpg" title="moodboard impact" alt="moodboard impact"  xlink:title="moodboard impact" />
<br /></p>
<p ><strong>If you had the opportunity to create any other kind of scent for Star Trek, what would it be? We've wondered what it smells like on a Borg ship – probably not great.</strong></p>
<p >Being a perfumer, I tend to be curious about any scent. Any scent, pleasant or unpleasant, is interesting. Exploring the unusual – like this opportunity – is even more exciting. Any new universe would make me happy to explore. What about a Borg ship? I picture this as a very organized, simple-shaped material built of metal and data – somehow abstract and futuristic, so it should not smell familiar – surrounded by a very dark universe around. Therefore, it would smell of cold and metallic notes, with abstract aldehydes that can smell of hot iron and clean dry-cleaner. Maybe we'd include some incense in background, and some dry, woody notes to give a neat structure to the fragrance. </p>

标题：How Live Games Have Changed the Ubisoft Development Process 	 时间：2018-03-27T12:00:00 	 内容：<p >Player activity in Ubisoft games has doubled over the past two years, and live games – that is, games that receive continuous, post-launch support and content updates – have been a key part of managing and supporting that growth. As the Game Developers Conference kicked off in San Francisco last week, Vice President of Online Services Stephanie Perotti detailed the ways in which the live strategy has come to reshape Ubisoft's development process in recent years. During Ubisoft's annual corporate GDC event, Perotti illustrated how live operations have become integral to every step of development, from continual post-launch updates to creating a scalable infrastructure of tools and resources to help developers do their jobs.</p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/tctd_skirmish_02_clean_1512164808_960x540_321173.jpg" title="TCTD_Skirmish_02_Clean_1512164808_960x540" alt="TCTD_Skirmish_02_Clean_1512164808_960x540"  xlink:title="TCTD_Skirmish_02_Clean_1512164808_960x540" />
<br /></p>
<p >"Launching a game is only the beginning," says Perotti. "[It's been] a very big shift from the way we used to ship and manage games to live services, and that also meant a big shift for our production teams. The way we used to ship games, the way we used to build games, was not necessarily adapted to... that kind of constant updates and constant content releases."</p>
<p >This meant implementing new, faster, largely automated pipelines and tools to ensure that development teams could release new code every day, if needed. Ubisoft is continually investing in its internal data centers, Perotti says, and has partnered with leading cloud services to make sure that game servers are readily available and scalable to the number of players online. The initiative also led to the creation of new roles, with support staff embedded into development teams to provide 24/7 support. Teams have also enlisted the community, with projects like R6 Fix, The Division's Public Test Server, and the Space Monkey Program bringing player feedback to the developers more quickly.   </p>
<p >Despite the scale of the shift, Ubisoft was ready for it, because its teams were eager to collaborate and participate in the transition. "Everything was fluid, if not perfect with all the different groups," Perotti says. "It's a chain. It's production. But a lot of the teams involved got together, learned together, and adapted together. That's the Ubisoft way." </p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/rb6_dustline_screenshot_valkyrie_night_1462799291_960x540_321172.jpg" title="RB6_DustLine_Screenshot_VALKYRIE_Night_1462799291_960x540" alt="RB6_DustLine_Screenshot_VALKYRIE_Night_1462799291_960x540"  xlink:title="RB6_DustLine_Screenshot_VALKYRIE_Night_1462799291_960x540" />
<br /></p>
<p >That methodology has helped contribute to the ongoing success of games like The Division, Ghost Recon Wildlands, and Rainbow Six Siege, which is now in its third year with a community that is still growing. Still, Perotti admits there were a lot of challenges on the road to that success. "We did a lot of these things before, not all of them were successful," Perroti says. "Growth was a challenge. A lot of things needed to be done quickly, which isn't necessarily the best way, but you have to adapt and improve continuously."  </p>
<p >Ubisoft has already shown how its services can span multiple platforms and connect players in new ways. Its current lineup of VR games (Eagle Flight, Star Trek: Bridge Crew, and Werewolves Within) and user-generated content for Trials all support cross-platform functionality. And while it seems like everything is in place for Ubisoft to expand that functionality to other games, it's up to the individual teams to decide whether or not cross-platform balancing would become too much of an issue. "If we want to go there, we're ready," Perroti says. </p>
<p >As for the future, Perotti sees Ubisoft opening more of its services to players, giving them the opportunity to modify and potentially create their own new services. "[We want to] put more services in the hands of players," she says. "At some point, we want to open services to the community, so we're working on that right now. That's one of the next key steps." </p>

标题：Women of Ubisoft – Jolie Menzel 	 时间：2018-03-26T17:00:00 	 内容：<p >South Park: The Fractured But Whole is a game based on a massively popular TV show, filled with a roster of well-known characters. Balancing those narrative elements within the realm of an RPG is no small task. Luckily for everyone involved, Jolie Menzel was hired. Originally brought on as a level designer, Menzel quickly recognized the need for a dialogue system and a narrative team, and decided to expand her role to fill these needs.</p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/ubiblog-women_of_ubi-jolie-news_image_321105.jpg" title="Jolie (in article)" alt="Jolie (in article)"  xlink:title="Jolie (in article)" />
<br /></p>
<p >The Jersey Shore native graduated from the Savannah College of Art and Design with a degree in Sequential Art. After attending her first GDC while still in school, Menzel secured a job offer from Telltale Games before she even graduated. The job brought her to the Bay Area, and a few years later, she started at Ubisoft working on The Fractured But Whole. Menzel joined the company as a fan of Assassin's Creed and Far Cry, and is particularly fond of Assassin's Creed Syndicate's dual protagonists, and the relaxing and educational nature of Discovery Tour in Assassin's Creed Origins. </p>
<p >As the Lead Narrative Designer, Menzel is tasked with managing the entire story of The Fractured But Whole, which includes making sure it stays true to the vision of the show's creators. She also spearheaded the development of the game's custom dialogue tool to ensure that all in-game dialogue was more personal than ever before. Menzel and I spoke at the Women in Gaming Rally, where she was a mentor at the Women Make Games luncheon. </p>
<p ><strong>What types of games do you like?</strong></p>
<p ><strong>Jolie Menzel</strong>: I was never really into action games as a girl. It wasn't because anyone told me I shouldn't be playing them; it was more because I didn't like killing things. I was more into the Nintendo world, because death in those games is very squishy and bouncy. Pokémon don't die, they faint. There's no blood in those games, but the nice thing is that they've maintained their reputation as being "real games." I also love Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, even though I'm really bad at it (laughs). </p>
<p ><strong>How do you transition from a level designer to a narrative designer?</strong></p>
<p ><strong>JM</strong>: I really just have this innate need to tell stories and share a story with the player or viewer. That goes back to college; I was always writing comics or fan-fiction, I wanted to tell stories in whatever way I could. When I was really young, I used to mod games to change the dialogue of certain characters. I've also been lucky enough to have had a lot of great mentors that helped me improve while at Ubisoft, like Ken Strickland and Jason Schroeder. </p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/ubiblog-women_of_ubi-spfbw-01_321106.jpg" title="SPFBW-01" alt="SPFBW-01"  xlink:title="SPFBW-01" />
<br /></p>
<p ><strong>Have you had female role models during your career?</strong></p>
<p ><strong>JM</strong>: When I was in school, Brenda Romero was teaching there, and she's such a luminary figure in games. I never even had a class with her, but just knowing she was there was enough for me to be like, "I can make games! Brenda's making games!" </p>
<p >At Ubisoft, Heather Haefner has been amazing. She has such a vision for Ubisoft as a force for promoting diversity in games. She helped reach out to the Girls Make Games initiative. Just knowing that that mentality is part of our studio culture has given me a lot of confidence to help out with those causes as well. I feel comfortable to come to places like this Women in Gaming Rally because of that culture that Heather helps foster. She was actually one of the first female connections I made at Ubisoft because I do so many talks that require PR approval. </p>
<p >I work with a lot of great women; Emiko Sunaga over in Osaka, for example. She's a mom, a great designer, and bilingual. She does it all, and it's all on her skill. She succeeds because she's skillful and friendly and personable and nice. There are so many wonderful women on my team, I can't even name all of them, but if reading this and you're on my team, you're amazing.</p>
<p ><strong>Why do you think there's such a large gender diversity gap in game development?</strong></p>
<p ><strong>JM</strong>: There are a lot of reasons, and it goes all the way back to childhood. Games are often put in the boys section of the store, and there aren't as many games for girls. Even the games that are marketed at women have a stigma attached to them that they're not "real games." They're the "quiet" games, the "pet" games, the "softer" games for women. That can be disenfranchising, because you can be stuck in this vortex where you might not feel invited to reach out and try other types of games. </p>
<p >As you get older and older, that gender gap becomes more apparent. Women are told we have to dress a certain way, act a certain way, and behave "lady-like." A lot of women I know who are into games today had brothers growing up. That's a common "explanation" for why a women is into gaming, but that typically means she had a family that supported her decision to do what she wanted. Some women didn't grow up with that home support so they were never really introduced into the culture. </p>
<p >There's also a somewhat toxic community in some games that sees them as a strictly masculine thing. Some gaming communities can be somewhat caustic to people who aren't cis white men. There can be a lot of points of friction in a woman's life where she thinks, "Well, maybe games aren't for me." </p>
<p ><strong>Have you ever felt like games were meant for people who weren't you?</strong></p>
<p ><strong>JM</strong>: You know, I never even thought about it. I used to play games all the time as a girl and it never once crossed my mind that I could be playing as a woman. It wasn't weird to me that I was playing as a guy; that's how every game is. The realization that there weren't many women really only came once I entered the industry. When people started asking, "Where is the female representation?" When Feminist Frequency started doing their critiques is really when I realized, "Oh yeah, why couldn't I play as a woman in all these games?" I never realized it wasn't a choice, until it was offered as a choice. It feels like a more common thing for minorities now. There's so few minority protagonists in games, and I feel like a lot of young people I meet who are minorities don't even realize that it's possible until they're shown it. </p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/ubiblog-women_of_ubi-spfbw-02_321107.jpg" title="SPFBW-02" alt="SPFBW-02"  xlink:title="SPFBW-02" />
<br /></p>
<p ><strong>South Park: The Fractured But Whole has one of the most interesting gender selection mechanics I've ever seen. Did you have any part in that?</strong></p>
<p ><strong>JM</strong>: Yeah! That was a joke Matt [Stone] and Trey [Parker] wanted to tell really early on. They thought it would be interesting if the game let you pick more than two genders. The interesting part is that that choice resonated throughout the entire game, because we suddenly needed gender-neutral pronouns. I was explaining the intricacies of gender to Matt and Trey, and they just told me write the whole sequence, actually! So I wrote the missions where Mr. Mackey helps you build your gender. It was tough to communicate it all to the team. I had to make these big flow charts like, "OK, these are female-presenting genders that use the female pronouns, these are the male ones, and these are the neutral ones." We are actually the first Ubisoft game to use gender-neutral pronouns! </p>
<p ><strong>What advice would you give to a woman who wants to do what you do?</strong></p>
<p ><strong>JM</strong>: I'd tell her to surround yourself with allies, find role models, and find mentors as early as you can. I know that's easier said than done, but you can go online and look at GDC talks, look at Twitter, and find women in games to remind yourself that you're not alone, and that goes for any minority group. Seek out the people who you see parts of yourself in, and try to connect with them and the people they keep in their circles. Find a network of people you can feel safe around and help you grow. </p>
<p ><strong>What's the best advice you've ever been given?</strong> </p>
<p ><strong>JM</strong>: I think "trust yourself," which seems so basic but it's important. I was 20 when I entered the games industry. I was just a girl and a kid to most people. I was lucky enough, when I got to San Francisco, that I found of group of people who validated me, that said "we don't care what your age is, we don't care what your gender is, you have valid things to say." And a lot of these people were cis-gendered white men who wanted to hear my story because they were tired of hearing and seeing their story. That was pivotal for me; if I hadn't met those people, I probably wouldn't be anywhere near this point in my career, I'd likely be much more junior. They really gave me the confidence to advance further. </p>
<p ><strong>What can more diversity bring to development teams?</strong></p>
<p ><strong>JM</strong>: First and foremost, originality. A more diverse pool is going to help you think in ways you weren't thinking before. It means ideas are going to go through more iterations and viewpoints. Cultural reference points will change how a game is made. Then, once the game releases, suddenly you have a more diverse audience that's connecting to your game in a greater way, because maybe someone in a meeting once raised their hand and gave a unique opinion based on their background. Embrace the difficult topics, talk about race, talk about gender, and get the viewpoints of those people on your team. </p>
<p ><strong>What does the Women in Gaming Rally mean to you?</strong></p>
<p ><strong>JM</strong>: I get to be the mentor I never had while I was in school. It was life-changing to me just to know we had a female game-design dean in school. That gave me the confidence to pursue games and sign up for a couple game electives. Seeing a possible career path as a young woman was so important to me, and I want to pay that forward. </p> 
标题：Far Cry 5 – Creating Curiosity in a Familiar World 	 时间：2018-03-26T12:00:00 	 内容：<p >When you're let out into Far Cry 5's Hope County for the first time, it's hard not to be mesmerized by the breathtaking vistas and seemingly infinite landscapes of Montana. The rural setting seems absolutely beautiful, but is it really? What do we mean when we call an environment "beautiful?" What description do level designers aspire to when they create their landscapes? Is there a more suitable way to capture the feeling of a setting? After sitting down with Associate Level Design Directors Alain Greco and Andrejs Verlis, it became clear that their intention was never to build a "beautiful" world; rather, they wanted to create something that would more accurately be referred to as "sublime and picturesque." </p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/dutch_321091.jpg" title="Dutch" alt="Dutch"  xlink:title="Dutch" />
<br /></p>
<p >In "An Essay on the Picturesque, As Compared With the Sublime and Beautiful," Uvedale Price outlines a clear distinction between the beautiful, the sublime, and the picturesque. The beautiful represents man-made order and harmony. The picturesque is characterized by roughness and intricacy, it can be man-made, but must look natural. The sublime signifies the openness, mystery, and infinite nature of landscape and is nearly impossible to recreate in the real-world. After getting some hands-on time running around Hope County, Montana in Far Cry 5, I was struck by how much of Price's theory, particularly on the sublime and picturesque, comes through in the natural landscape. The enigmatic Montanan countryside feels endless and constantly begs you to explore it. There is a continuous desire to see what's just beyond that hill or through that forest and it is here, in that sense of mystery, that Hope County embodies the sublime and the picturesque qualities of landscape. </p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/dense_321090.jpg" title="dense" alt="dense"  xlink:title="dense" />
<br /></p>
<p >How exactly do you foster sublimity and encourage curiosity? "We actually imagined the world as if there was no conflict, no story, just as it is," says Greco. "How would players play that game? Where would they go, why would they go there? We wanted the exploration to feel organic based on the landscape itself, not necessarily because of a mission or objective marker. So we looked at what locations naturally inspired curiosity, and modified our locations to tap into the inherent mystery of the land." </p>
<p >By creating and exploring an environment devoid of enemies, landmarks, or buildings, Greco and his team enabled the landscape itself to supply the motivation and mystery required for exploration. And while it makes perfect sense to build objectives and locations to suit the environment, why and how we navigate a space relies on an understanding of real-world curiosity and exploration. </p>
<p >"We wanted to rely on real-world experiences, so that players explore the landscape how they would in real life," says Greco. "If you see a small path leading into a clearing, you'll probably follow that. If you see smoke billowing from just over a hill, you'll probably try to find it. We wanted to invite that sense of curiosity and exploration. We hope that the same language we use to direct the player is the same language they already know from real life." </p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/smoke_321088.jpg" title="smoke" alt="smoke"  xlink:title="smoke" />
<br /></p>
<p >Perhaps this is why Hope County feels so real. As soon as I was let out into the open world, I was free to explore in any direction I wanted, and yet my eyes were drawn down natural pathways. A sign post encouraged me to travel in one direction, a campfire another, a water tower in another. I was able to identify multiple objectives and points of interest without having to rely on the HUD at all. </p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/pathways_321093.jpg" title="pathways" alt="pathways"  xlink:title="pathways" />
<br /></p>
<p >This level of organic wayfinding has bled into other aspects of exploration in Far Cry 5. No longer will your map automatically reveal locations of wild animals; you'll have to find signposts peppered throughout the world that signify which animals are indigenous to which regions. Being explicitly told where to go and where things are belongs in the realm of the beautiful; Far Cry 5 fully embraces the mystery of the sublime. Suddenly, I understood Price's notion that "the passion caused by the great and sublime in nature...is astonishment."</p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/sign_321087.jpg" title="sign" alt="sign"  xlink:title="sign" />
<br /></p>
<p >Considering the sheer scope and level of detail within Hope County, It's easy to look at the massive map in Far Cry 5 and assume that much, if not all of it, was procedurally generated. While procedural generation was used for the placement of many of the natural assets, like foliage and boulders, by and large the map is handcrafted. </p>
<p >"You have to design the world within the context of game progression and player progression," says Verlis. "We need to have full control of the navigation and the flow." Procedural generation can yield highly disordered results with little to no identifiable logic, and while this may emulate the chaos of nature, it does little to help guide the player through the world. "You want the landscape to be natural, but you don't want it to be chaotic. You want to be able to carve out the logic and the routes through the world. You can see things in nature that seem to be ordered; that appeals to us as humans," says Verlis.</p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/water_321089.jpg" title="water" alt="water"  xlink:title="water" />
<br /></p>
<p >What becomes clear is that Far Cry 5's Montana not only abides by the rules of the sublime, but by those of the picturesque as well. If procedural generation is as close as it gets to recreating the randomness of nature, then handcrafted environments are akin to a man-made park. It may look organic, but there is an underlying logic that helps encourage players to explore in one direction or another. The handcrafted world feels anything but, and that is where the appeal in the picturesque lies. It's an appeal Verlis understands and takes advantage of. </p>
<p >"By utilizing natural aspects of the landscape, you can help to guide players and lead them in one direction or the other;" he says. "That's where the picturesque comes in. Valleys can act as natural funnels for players. Roads and rivers can help guide them down an intended path. There's a bread-crumbing notion; once you get into an appealing space, how do we then bring you into the next space? Even if you can't see a destination, you feel like there will be one there."</p>
<p >Price concludes his essay with the thought that "the effect of the picturesque is curiosity." By constructing a landscape that embodies qualities of the sublime and the picturesque, the level-design team has ensured that nearly every corner of Hope County will stoke the flames of curiosity among players.  </p>

标题：Far Cry 5 – 8 Starter Tips for Taking Back Hope County 	 时间：2018-03-26T12:00:00 	 内容：<p >In Far Cry 5, things get very dicey, very quickly. A fanatical cult is subjugating Hope County, and people are looking to you for help. What's a well-intentioned, sparsely armed deputy to do? Figuring out how you want to handle the challenges ahead is entirely up to you, but let us offer some advice. These tips will help you no matter which path you choose, and they may just help you find new paths, new challenges, and new rewards.  </p>
<p ><iframe data-agegate="17" src="https://youtube.com/embed/WjW5VuVXTME"> </iframe></p>
<p ><strong>Be the Boss</strong></p>
<p >You may have been just a deputy when you flew into Hope County, but now that you're part of the resistance, it's time to take charge. Your Guns for Hire will make themselves useful in a firefight, but there are a few ways you can help them help you even better. Start by ordering them around. Positioning them to cover another angle before things get loud can help split up your enemies' attentions during the fight so you don't bear the brunt of the aggression. (Note that if you're going in quiet and order them to take someone out, they will do their best to run in for a stealth kill.) Ordering a Gun for Hire to take out specific targets is a good way to rack up their kill count, and the more kills they get, the quicker they level up and unlock new skills. These skills make them much better allies and enable you to pick your squad strategically based on their strengths. Or you could just recruit a Specialist or two; they come ready to rumble with their skills already unlocked. </p>
<p ><strong>Take a Hike</strong></p>
<p >Some of the best Far Cry 5 moments come when you aren't expecting them. You might follow a trailhead and be treated with a gorgeous view of a cascading mountain stream. You might hear shouts coming from a copse of trees and find a man being attacked by a cougar. Maybe you're just shooting off your guns in a remote area when some cultists hear the commotion and come looking for a fight, conveniently bringing you an ATV to ride away in. A stranger might give you a tip on a nearby prepper cache, or they might just give you a window into what it's been like living in Hope County as the cult has crept in. Encounters like this fill the world of Far Cry 5, rewarding exploration with loot to sell and stories to tell. Every trail leads somewhere, so why not go for a hike?</p>
<p ><strong>Or Take Flight</strong></p>
<p >Hiking may be a great way to explore Hope County's finer details, but if you really want to get a lay of the land, there's no better option than helicopter or plane. Finding one or the other to "borrow" may be tricky in the early moments of the game (you can rent them from specific stations later), but once you do, take the time to scout the different regions and take note of landmarks you may want to explore. You may find that your original plans change quickly once you realize there's something extra-weird about that big statue of Joseph Seed... or the giant cheeseburger, or the gunfire at the prison. </p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/fc5-ubiblog-hunting-960x540_321100.jpg" title="Hunting" alt="Hunting" xlink:title="Hunting"  />
<br /></p>
<p ><strong>On The Hunt</strong></p>
<p >Montana has a lot of wild animals, and taking some time to hunt while you're out roaming is a great way to bring in some extra money. Animal hides and feathers can be traded with shopkeepers for cash, and that extra cash is great for customizing the weapons you already own or buying new ones. Put a sizable scope on your magnum, add a silencer to your shotgun, or paint a really tactical bright-red tiger pattern on your assault rifle; it's all there, but it's not free. If you're on the hunt and not having much luck, don't forget to toss out bait, which can lure out some of the more valuable game.</p>
<p ><strong>Get Prepped</strong></p>
<p >You may not be the kind of person who builds a secure underground bunker and stocks it with enough supplies to last for years, but some Hope County citizens certainly are. And with the drastic uptick in cult-related violence, there are many prepper caches just waiting to support whichever side gets there first. Whenever you hear mention of a prepper cache, take note. Powerful weapons, generous helpings of perk points, and a bunkerload of cash are just some of the rewards awaiting the intrepid investigator. Sure, you might have to puzzle out how to get the door open or contend with an ornery wolverine who lives inside, but it will be well worth the effort and/or flesh wounds. </p>
<p ><strong>Challenge Accepted</strong></p>
<p >Don't forget about the Challenges menu. You'll find challenges for nearly everything, including getting kills with specific weapons, flying a certain distance with your wingsuit, or collecting a certain number of wildlife skins. Each completed challenge rewards perk points, and they can be an easy way to build up your perks early on. Which leads us to...</p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/fc5-ubiblog-wingsuit-960x540_321101.jpg" title="Wingsuit" alt="Wingsuit" xlink:title="Wingsuit"  />
<br /></p>
<p ><strong>Save Up Your Perk Points</strong></p>
<p >Far Cry 5's perk system lets you unlock a lot of cool new abilities, including a couple that'll make your life much easier if you unlock them early on – but that means having the patience to save up for them. The Air Drop perk will allow you drop out of the sky when fast-traveling; couple this with the wingsuit and parachute perks, and suddenly you're a one-person airstrike. Is there an outpost you want to hit, but don't feel like making the hike from your nearest fast-travel point? Wingsuiting from an air drop gives you the ability to cover huge distances in a hurry – and you'll have the added benefit of taking any guards by surprise as you sail in from above.  </p>
<p >Also, you're only as good as your arsenal, and starting out with just one main weapon slot doesn't allow for a lot of variety. If you want to switch between an assault rifle, crossbow, and sniper rifle on the fly, you'll need to unlock the "Additional Holster" and "Weapons Collector" perks. With three different weapons on hand, you'll be able to tackle most situations however you want. </p>
<p ><strong>Double Tap</strong></p>
<p >Some enemies will go down-but-not-out in Far Cry 5, meaning that they can be revived by a teammate. Don't be shy with your ammo, and make sure they're down for the count to prevent being overwhelmed. If you're particularly keen, you can use a downed enemy to lure out others from behind cover, taking them down one after another as they bravely rush out into the open. It's merciless, sure – but then, so is the cult.</p>

标题：How Ubisoft is Using AI to Make Its Games, and the Real World, Better 	 时间：2018-03-23T09:00:00 	 内容：<p >Seeing Yves Jacquier's face light up at the prospect of videogames contributing to the development of real-world artificial intelligence, it becomes clear that there is an exciting future ahead in which game AI and real-world AI are able to continuously improve one another. As the Executive Director of Production Studios Services, Jacquier heads up an innovative new initiative in Ubisoft Montreal called La Forge. La Forge's goal is to bridge the gap between the theoretical academic work on AI, and the practical applications for AI in videogames and in the real world. It is here, in La Forge's work, that Jacquier believes there is massive potential to revolutionize the way developers make games and to pursue innovations than impact everything from automated vehicles to medical procedures.</p>
<p >The relationship between AI and games is nothing new. With rulesets that encourage complex thinking within specific parameters, games have been a valuable testing platform for AI systems. IBM's chess-playing computer Deep Blue defeating world-champion chess player Gary Kasparov 21 years ago is perhaps the most famous example, but recently, the relationship has evolved and AI has helped make the games themselves. To illustrate this, Jacquier uses an example from a motion capture session. </p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/animationcleanup_321004.gif" title="AnimationCleanup" alt="AnimationCleanup"  xlink:title="AnimationCleanup" />
<br /></p>
<p >Traditionally, raw data from motion capture requires quite a bit of manual cleanup by an animator to look real and natural. Processing a given chunk of data might take a human around four hours, while an AI can achieve almost the same result in about four minutes. While AI animation programs can't create everything that NPC humans need to do, they are already contributing by generating increasingly realistic locomotion animations, including the notoriously tricky foot placements. Jacquier believes that gap between human and AI NPC creation will close within the next three years.</p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/walkinganimations_321006.gif" title="WalkingAnimations" alt="WalkingAnimations"  xlink:title="WalkingAnimations" /> </p>
<p >So how does this AI assistance help game developers? By using AI to perform some of the more monotonous and repetitive tasks like testing builds, predicting and identifying bugs, and automating balance tests, it opens up the possibilities for developers to focus more on the creative aspects of a game. Instead of spending hours animating lips for different language tracks, the developer could task an AI to generate those animations (as seen below), and maybe spend more time fine-tuning other facial expressions. </p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/language_321005.gif" title="Language" alt="Language"  xlink:title="Language" />
<br /></p>
<p >According to Jacquier, "The distinction between AI and humans is all about creativity. AI is good at generalizing and imitating. If you can spot a repetitive task, AI can help automate that, that's generalizing. Imitating is showing an AI an objective and the AI can accelerate you towards that objective. That lets you create a wide variety of assets or a larger world, but these alone do not make a game. Humans will always be responsible for the creating the fun in a game." </p>
<p >Drawing upon real world examples, Jacquier brought up self-driving cars and the possible ethical dilemmas they present. AI improves with data, but accurate data can be difficult to come by when there is a potential for human harm. Videogames, notably vast open-world games that simulate numerous real-world systems, can be a valuable source of such data. The example Jacquier used showed a self-driving car driving through the streets of San Francisco in Watch Dogs 2. The simulation is able to assess many factors that would be too difficult, time-consuming, or dangerous to recreate in the physical world, as you can see from the clip below. </p>
<p ><img src="https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/marketingresource/en-us/images/ai_driver_321003.gif" title="AI_Driver" alt="AI_Driver"  xlink:title="AI_Driver" />
<br /></p>
<p >This relationship can be a two-way street; just as videogames can provide insight to improve real-world systems, those same systems can feed data back into videogames to help create more immersive and realistic experiences. Jacquier reflected, "I think that it goes both ways, working with people who have a great knowledge of how real systems work and having us on the simulation side of the equation presents a win-win situation. They will be able to test their systems faster and we'll be able to learn a lot from them to make games more interesting and realistic."  </p>
<p >The breadth of the work being done at La Forge means there are many more areas that Jacquier only touched briefly on where AI development shows this kind of mutually beneficial promise. One project involves using the work of surgery specialists to automate the transformation of NPC faces between traditionally male and traditionally female, which could lead to better character variety and representation. </p>
<p >The future of AI in game development is full of possibilities, but one thing is certain: the work that La Forge is doing has the potential to dramatically impact much more than just videogames. As Jacquier said, "The most exciting part for me is the possibility that, at some point five or 10 years from now, we're able to say that videogames helped us make a safer and better world."</p>
